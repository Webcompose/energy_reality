title: Welcome to the Energy Reality Book: The Necessary Renaissance

---

This is a project that plans to use markdown as a way to organize chapters and the books contents.

The intent is to create a workflow that is as simple yet complex enough to deliver a non-fiction book.

Keep in mind that a non-fiction book has a significant front section, a content section and a back section.

Any workflow to publish a book needs to be able to accomplish what a word processor does such as page numbers, chapter numbers, headers and footers etc.
