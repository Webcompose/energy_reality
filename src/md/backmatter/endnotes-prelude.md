</a> - edited by M. Mercedes Maroto-Valer

> "Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) represents a key component of a larger porfolio of advanced energy technologies and climate policies needed to mediate the rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Geologic CCS systems are specifically designed to remove CO₂ from various point sources and safely deposit CO₂ in secure storage sites deep underground..."

The experiments for ocean CCS still needs greater investigation.

<span class="endnotebold">0-8</span>Book: <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/non-solutions-project-Mathijs-Beckers-ebook/dp/B01N6SN5E1/" target="_blank">Non-Solutions Project</a>: Here are a few quotes from Mathijs Beckers' book. He does an excellent job of projecting the amount of materials needed to run a so-called 100% renewables scenario. Beckers does an admirable job of laying it all out using graphs, equations, numbers and analysis:

> "Copper has many uses: wiring; in semiconductors as circuitry; in piping and plumbing; as a building material; in electric motors; we even use it as a hull material for boats, but renewables have only had a marginal share of all available copper. However, that will change if we choose to implement the 100%WWS Roadmap. Copper use for wind and solar is currently only 3.3%, but if we adopt the roadmap plan it could rise to 75~80%. The limitations of copper production might just be the straw that will break the camel's back..."

> "It is important to note that known reserves are roughly 720,000 thousand metric tons. Suppose we could reach 100,000 TWh of annual energy production on Wind and Solar, and it would require 200,000 thousand metric tons of copper, we would have extracted more than one-fourth of all the copper known to be available. It is not so much the amount of copper required that makes this challenge so big, it is about the increase in copper production growth required, that makes it hard to achieve..."

> "Even if we keep production as high as possible, we wouldn't be able to build all the wind turbines and solar panels required before 2050 due to the deficit in copper. Also note that we are already behind 1500 GW of annual required wind and solar additions (which is about 15 times more than we currently add)..."

> "Shortages of rare earths already plague the renewable industry. Research institutes confirm that there's a tremendous strain on resources already and foresee a shortage of materials in the not-so-distant future. I doubt that we can sustain the raw material production levels that are needed to facilitate this rapid growth in wind and solar as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap. And research and development on raw material recovery is lagging, so we may conclude that the 100%WWS Roadmap is already facing serious startup problems..."

> "If we want to do an all-out build-off bonanza as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap, we will be faced with massive shortages so long as mining capabilities trail behind the demand. Lake Baotou in China, which is a dystopian place, is one of the shady sides of rare earth mining. Once the rare earth materials have been mined, you have to separate them from the ore, which is done by a host of different chemical processes with hazardous tailings and other valuable elements going to waste..."

> "The people who work in the mines and live near the refineries pay the price for our technologies. So let's go for the technologies that are most efficient in terms of materials used. As long as we fail to clean up our mining and purification practices, 'clean energy' will be an oxymoron..."

> "However, we already have a safe, efficient, environmentally friendly technology for generating electricity―nuclear energy, especially when produced by modern plants that can "burn" our stored nuclear waste as fuel..."
