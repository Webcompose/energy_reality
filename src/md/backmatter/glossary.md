<strong>fertile</strong>: refers to the ability of a radiactive element to produce fissile elements by neutron bombardment <strong>²³⁸U,<sup>232</sup>Th :</strong> Uranium-238 and thorium-232 are known as fertile materials, and the production of fissile materials from them after capturing a neutron is known as breeding. When these fertile materials capture neutrons, they are converted into fissile plutonium -239 and uranium-233, respectively."<br />

<strong>fissile</strong>: means that an element is capable of experiencing fission <br />


FP: fission product<br />
FUJI: Japanese MSR concept<br />

<strong>Generation IV Reactors:</strong> : "The most developed Gen IV reactor design, the sodium fast reactor, has received the greatest share of funding over the years with a number of demonstration facilities operated. The principal Gen IV aspect of the design relates to the development of a sustainable closed fuel cycle for the reactor. The molten-salt reactor, a less developed technology, is considered as potentially having the greatest inherent safety of the six models.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor#cite_note-2" target="_blank">[2]</a><a href="">[3]</a> The very-high-temperature reactor designs operate at much higher temperatures. This allows for high temperature electrolysis for the efficient production of hydrogen and the synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels.<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513006083?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">[1]</a><br />

The majority of the 6 designs are generally not expected to be available for commercial construction until 2020–30.[4] Currently the majority of reactors in operation around the world are considered second generation reactor systems, as the vast majority of the first generation systems were retired some time ago, and there are only few Generation III reactors in operation as of 2014. Generation V reactors refer to reactors that are purely theoretical and are therefore not yet considered feasible in the short term, resulting in limited R&D funding." <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_IV_reactor" target="_blank">Wikipedia: Generation IV Reactor</a><br />

MOX: mixed oxide fuel (U + Pu oxides) – reactor fuel, developed by the French,  is made from uranium oxide and plutonium oxide. Usually the plutonium is sourced from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and has the isotopic profile known as ‘reactor grade’, indicating it is high in plutonium-240. The exact composition in the American program, in collaboration with AREVA ,to start in 2016 in South Carolina, is different because the plutonium is sourced from dismantled US nuclear warheads, meaning it is ‘weapons grade’ and high in plutonium-239 instead and has a correspondingly different operational signature.
