For Fivver and other collaborators:

The two directories that matter most right now are docs and src.
The project here is to assemble a book from the mardown files located in the src directory.

My basic newbie understanding is that the files can be parsed and output to an html page with pagination and
other book-like features such as a table of contents, frontmatter in this case acknowledgement and prelude, content:chapters 
numbering headers and page numbers, backmatter: glosary endnotes and index.

You will notice the work done by a previous collaborator who needed to withdraw from the project.

There are several .md files and .less files that are css. There are a few .json
and as I understand it I may need to create a .yaml file as well

I started to install jekyll and that explains some of the recent content.

There is a workflow.md file that has some possible guidelines to look into solutions
