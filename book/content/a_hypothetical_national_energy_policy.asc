== A Hypothetical National Energy Policy

How we use Energy is the single most significant factor affecting
Climate and Global Ocean Chemistry. Seeing how release of greenhouse
gas, particularly carbon dioxide, has such a profound effect on the
average global temperature and ocean acidity it becomes necessary to
factor that into the decision process of choosing the best energy mix.

Designing and using an energy mix which works in tandem with
sustainable, natural processes is a noble goal. Such a holistic
eco-system is not so easy to achieve mostly because of a lack of shared
knowledge, political will and a lack of public awareness. The technology
exists today to create conditions globally for all people to thrive and
prosper, but the main obstacle is ignorance and fear.

Why Nuclear Power Plants Matter

Keeping all, or most, of the world’s currently operating reactors is a
necessary strategy. In fact we need many more. See how China has stepped
up their energy plan with nuclear power.9-1 Senator Lamar Alexander
understands the need for more reactors. ``I have proposed that we build
100 new reactors, which may seem excessive, but not with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies saying up to 25 of our 99 nuclear
reactors could close by 2020.''9-2

Dense, carbon free, nuclear energy gives many economic and environmental
advantages that satisfy a fundamental need for reliable and steady
power.

How All Commercial Nuclear Power Plants Serve Humanity

We have taken for granted almost a century of reliable electricity
reaching our homes. The demand for electricity is continually growing,
especially in places like China, India and Africa. They know that the
cheapest and most reliable way to create electricity is the same as it
has been for nearly a century and that is dirty coal.

When nuclear plants started to flourish in the 1960s and 70s the demand
for coal shrunk very significantly. The economics of nuclear was very
competitive with coal. For over thirty years France has had a thriving
economy. Over 70% of their energy comes from nuclear power. In the U.S.
its 20%. The number of coal plants that did not need to be built
prevented more dirty emissions from happening. Since its inception
``Nuclear power may have saved 1.8 million lives otherwise lost to
fossil fuels, may save up to 7 million more…''8-4 over the next 40
years. (blog Scientific American - April 2, 2013) The numbers are
boggling how much carbon dioxide we could have prevented but did not and
now we are paying the price.

So-called ``Renewables'' Are Unreliable and Not Renewable

The term ``renewables'' has taken on a legal definition designating
specific technologies that may be used to meet quota goals and/or be
eligible for subsidies. This word ``renewable'' unfortunately is used to
discriminate against new and existing hydro and nuclear power plants
although both are arguably more ``renewable'' than wind or solar.

``Sustainable'' is our preferred term and has more relevant meaning and
no legal entanglements. Although this word is also misused. You rarely
see nuclear praised as being sustainable but it gives the most energy
for the smallest amount of fuel. This demonstrates that a significant
bias does exist. Nuclear waste is viewed as somehow unacceptable when,
if you have read this far, you will know the waste is well managed and
safely stored in dry casks and will serve as a future power source for
new reactors. Yes, what we call waste is perfectly good fuel for
producing electricity. That’s because only 5% of the fuel that goes into
current reactors gets utilized. A handful of companies expect to have
nuclear reactor prototypes that will consume used fuel (``nuclear
waste'') in less than 10 years.

Wind and Solar are intermittent energy sources. That’s a very
significant fact. It means that other sources of energy and/or storage
capacity are needed in order to provide energy through the periods when
wind and solar cannot function. So how is wind and solar renewable? It’s
only renewable if it’s available. In a 24/7 world that’s not good
enough. The capital investment and the environmental costs of
compensating for the intermittency of wind and solar should be included
in the estimates of the cost for comparison purposes.

Can Distribution of Electricity Solve the Intermittency Problem?

The theory goes that if you have in place enough wind turbines and solar
panels over a wide enough land area, that there will always be enough
wind or enough sun available. But we all know that the entire continent
goes dark for several hours every day. And, yes, there is never a
completely still day over the continent, but that does not really matter
because what counts is that the power lines needed to even test this
theory would be in far greater quantities than we could afford to build
and the manpower needed to actually  mine the copper would not be
feasible. See Mathijs Beckers report, book and video.

Wind has the most money expended for electrical power gained and is
known for disrupting smooth grid transmissions. Solar can be less
disruptive if installed locally, meaning, used by local homes, schools,
or businesses for non grid applications such as heating water or
recharging batteries for low power devices.

Reclassifying Nuclear as Renewable

Ohio, Arizona, Idaho and Missouri have initiatives to classify nuclear
as renewable. This is a positive step towards making this a true nuclear
energy era. On the other hand scrapping the use of renewable on the grid
might be what’s needed. Perhaps the various types of power should be
considered on their own merits. Perhaps keeping renewable energy off the
grid should be made a legal requirement for renewable energy use in some
locations.

Wind and Solar and other intermittent energy sources need a new
strategy. Separation of base load dependent electrical use and less
critical electrical use is needed so that renewable energy sources can
be applied locally and coupled with storage and not made part of the
same grid that carries base load.

Feeling Good Can Be Expensive

Most of us are seduced by the idea of clean renewable energy until we
realize that feeling good is expensive. When we deploy wind turbines
(wind mills) and solar we are building what can be described as a very
diffuse energy supply. In other words it takes a lot of them to create
useful electricity. But since they cannot do that in any reliable way we
need to have natural gas, coal plants or nuclear plants to replace them
when they are down. But that disadvantage comes with a price. Ironically
``renewable'' energy is heavily subsidized. The structure of that
agreement that subsidizes renewable guarantees that they get
compensation as if the wind is blowing 24/7. But when they are not
running (which is frequently) we need to pay for the power that replaces
them. That means the power utility company charges you twice. Once for
the inflated costs of temporary stretches of wind and solar energy and
again for the replacement energy needed when the wind and sunlight are
missing.

When Is Solar OK?

Solar on rooftops, in areas where it is frequently warm and sunny, can
be used for local power to reduce energy needed from grids powered with
fossil fuels. There is one distinct advantage over solar farms. The
power that is harnessed goes into the local users home or business and
it acts as a buffer that would not occur if the electricity came from a
solar farm. But if the grid is powered by enough nuclear there won’t be
a need for renewable energy. Wherever Nuclear Energy is located it does
not make sense to add wind or solar to those regions but since policy
often dictates and is hard to change we must give into political
pressure and build reactors that can load follow wind and solar. If the
leadership were to learn these facts a lot of expense could be spared.
What’s needed to make a much needed transition is a promotional campaign
to sing the praises of nuclear power.

When President Obama says let’s use ``all of the above'' he really means
he doesn’t have the will to make nuclear a platform issue. He does not
fully understand how serious our situation really is.

When is wind OK?

Wherever there is a windy remote community that does not have nuclear
then wind makes sense in a limited way. The problem is that adding wind
farms (also true for solar farms) to a grid near a large city will
destabilize and cause damage to the infrastructure. And perhaps the
worst effect of all is the cost of maintaining a system that has too
many surges to the system. Energy Reality is not totally against
renewable we just view the flawed technology as bad timing when nuclear
already does such a good job. The demand is too great to expect
renewables to be sufficient. The remediation of damage to our oceans and
atmosphere needs to start immediately.

Myths about Nuclear Power Plants

It is impossible for a nuclear reactor to have a nuclear detonation. The
kind of explosions that are possible are non-nuclear and the result of
extreme temperature. Pressurized water and/or hydrogen explosions are
possible but they occur in only the rarest circumstances. In fact the
evacuations have done more harm than good.

Pressurized reactors that currently exist have been known to have
hydrogen explosions. These have been damaging mostly to the local plant
and would not cause widespread contamination although Chernobyl did
spread radiation it serves as the absolute worst case scenario that no
reactor that has been built outside Soviet run Ukraine would ever be
capable of. Fukushima did release much smaller amounts of radiation in
the first days but subsided quickly. Both examples happened in old
reactors where human error had a greater potential and the operators
failed to follow recommended procedures.

Living near a nuclear plant is not a radiation risk. ``We are surrounded
by naturally occurring radiation.  Only 0.005% of the average American’s
yearly radiation dose comes from nuclear power; 100 times less than we
get from coal , 200 times less than a cross-country flight, and about
the same as eating 1 banana per year.''

We need to put our support toward North American initiatives and the
newest trend that is gaining traction is the Small Modular Reactor
(SMR). This is a trend that would speed up how quickly we build power
plants and bring down the costs.

Fossil Fuels 

Coal plants are the worst offenders by far! London’s Great Smog of 1952
is a perfect example.

 www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/teens/case-studies/great-smog

But all fossil fuel plants produce carbon dioxide. We already have an
inventory of CO₂ that recently passed the 400 ppm mark. CO₂ will need to
be removed from the air and oceans if we expect to reverse the effects
of global warming and climate change and at the same time save all the
species of fish and mammals from going extinct.

Natural Gas

This under-regulated industry has been abusive and treated with abuse.
There are sources that indicate it has had a positive impact on reducing
CO₂ that coal would otherwise produce. Yet other indications of methane
leaks lead us to believe the rewards are not big enough. Studies
indicate that there is effectively no green house gas reduction.

thebreakthrough.org/index.php/voices/energetics/us-exports-have-little-discernable-impact-on-massive-global-coal-growth

More details are here:

thebreakthrough.org/index.php/issues/natural-gas/faqs-on-natural-gas

But satellite data reveals a high level of methane release across the U.
S. Whenever any fossil fuels are involved it comes with a price.
Fracking has been doing its damage to the water table, the local
wildlife, the destruction is an invasion of the landscape and has
literally invaded adding earthquakes to the list of growing concerns.

Gas plants in Dakota flare off between 30% and 40%9-3 of the methane
they gather. That combustion is a problem! How much CO₂, anybody? Is
that part of the calculations done in studies on their contribution?

The average person views the water of the oceans as a limitless and
indestructible resource. Part of our policy needs to adapt a view on the
precious resources of water and oxygen. Water and air are not
replaceable. We must ensure these are properly preserved. Our children
and grandchildren will be affected by the degree to which we keep these
resources pure & clean.

New Perspective and Prospects for so-called Nuclear Waste

If there’s anything useful to know about nuclear waste is that the next
generation of reactors we will likely start using it as nuclear fuel
(not waste at all) for converting to energy. It is also easily managed
simply because the fuel does not change its physical size and takes up
very little room to start with.

Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) Show Great Promise With Many Advantages.

The Molten Salt Reactor is a Generation Four technology and is under
development in several countries. Those who are advocates of MSRs
recognize that it solves a great number of issues but also provides new
opportunities that never existed for existing nuclear technology.

With commercial roll-outs of MSRs in 6-9 years. MSRs are encouraged but
only if they are passively safe (walk away safe) and all indications
suggest that MSRs solves the common fears about reactors. All current
reactors have aspects that, although engineered well, still scare
people.

MSRs are not only passively safe but offers additional safety by having
no pressurized containment. Traditionally a worse case scenario for
current reactor designs has the possibility (although highly unlikely to
happen) of spreading radioactive particles for miles. This is not the
case with Molten Salt Reactors. Since the fuel is in a high temperature
liquid state with no steam to carry radioactive elements it will simply
harden when exposed to cooler surroundings.
