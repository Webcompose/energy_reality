== Proliferation Concerns

No internationally-regulated commercial nuclear plant can make
nuclear-weapons materials. They are under constant surveillance. Those
who try, face serious challenges. Nuclear-power reactors are unsuitable
for making nuclear bombs. North Korea is a poster child for their
defiance of the law enforcement attempts. They have been ruthless in
their disregard of the entire country’s population unable to meet their
basic human needs. Their people suffer both economically with food
shortages and politically with sanctions that keep them both isolated
and shunned. Partly because they chose a path of obtaining a production
reactor to acquire the weapons-grade fuel in order to make nuclear
weapons.

With regard to geopolitical affairs the definition of the word
``weapon'' has been pushed to the unthinkable. Take, for example, the
commercial airliners used as weapons to crash into the Twin Towers of
the 9/11 terrorist attack. Let’s set the record straight. A nuclear
reactor cannot have a nuclear explosion. The dilute mix of nuclear
elements makes a nuclear explosion impossible. The purity levels of the
specific isotopes are far too low. Very rarely relatively small hydrogen
gas explosions have been known to happen but with minimal threat beyond
the nuclear plant’s perimeter.

Nuclear plants are very resistant to acts of sabotage or natural
disaster and built to handle earthquakes, floods and terrorist attacks.

Because of the degree of specialized knowledge and resources needed for
a large team from many disciplines, no single individual could ever
build a nuclear weapon or a nuclear reactor. The monitoring of nuclear
facilities is aided by the fact that the detection of even the smallest
levels of radiation are now possible.  Let’s just say the probabilities
are extremely low that a reactor or a bomb would be built undetected.
The numerous challenges are listed below.

Economic Challenge

The cost of obtaining the weapon is most likely the first consideration.
The pursuit of nuclear weapons is so costly that only strong economies
can even consider doing it and maintaining, forever, whatever they
build. It would involve a multi-disciplinary team of experts all at the
top in their fields. Then collecting the required amount of fissile
material for processing to the correct enrichment is a long and tedious
process that could take years.

Legal Challenge

With safeguards in place to monitor and detect any kinds of irregular
activity as well as the treaties of international law that have been
negotiated, there are serious penalties a country faces if they break
those laws. Any hint of foul play and the country suddenly becomes the
focus of numerous law enforcement agencies such as the United Nations
Security Council.

The IAEA sets the guidelines for enforcement by the security council and
other agencies. But the IAEA has defined it’s objective as follows:
``The Agency shall seek to accelerate and enlarge the contribution of
atomic energy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the world. It
shall ensure, so far as it is able, that assistance provided by it or at
its request or under its supervision or control is not used in such a
way as to further any military purpose.''

Political Challenge

When such weapons are so destructive that whole populations are
threatened the greatest opposition will be from neighboring countries.
But most countries will protest any country wanting nuclear weapons. So
there is a risk of creating new enemies and hostile relations with the
many countries that would be affected.

Intellectual Challenge

The team required to create a nuclear weapon would need people from
several very different disciplines that would need to be highly skilled
and knowledgeable. Depending on the kind of nuclear weapon there would
be varying levels of complexity. If it is a missile with guidance
capability, that has specific rocket design capability, very specialized
detonators, precise chemistry and nuclear engineering and fuel source
that will require maintaining a balance of ingredients without
impurities.

Because the challenges are so great, it is far more likely that a
conventional means of creating weapons fuel would be used such as gas
centrifuges or specially designed non-commercial research reactors. Next
generation reactors have built-in advantages for improved safety and
proliferation resistance.

Reactors are Resistant to Terrorist and Military Threats

A plot to steal fuel from a conventional reactor is a very difficult
task and would very likely fail. They are both well guarded and
monitored. The elements available for bomb creation from a reactor are
quite limited. Uranium is the most likely target since the plutonium
that exists in reactors does not provide the essential balance of
isotopes.

Generation IV Reactors are more Resistant to Terrorist or Military
Threats

Any attempts to steal fuel from the new reactor designs that are in the
development and design stages called molten salt reactors, would be
particularly challenging due to high heat and high levels of radiation.

Providing detailed explanations of the various types of next generation
reactors is beyond the scope of this article but one point is worth
mentioning. The two types of molten salt reactors that can be classified
into general categories are the single fluid and the dual fluid designs.
The industry will most likely see the first Generation IV licenses for a
single fluid design molten salt reactor. This provides an advantage of
having the fuel mix prepared by mixing in what’s referred to as
denatured elements of specific isotopes such as ²³⁸U and U232. This has
a poisoning effect to the mixtures ability to be used as weapons fuel.
