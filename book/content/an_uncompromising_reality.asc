== An Uncompromising Reality

``The discovery of nuclear reactions need not bring about the
destruction of mankind any more than the discovery of matches.4-1''
-   Albert Einstein

=== The Obstacles

There are many reasons that this miracle of science has not flourished
despite the wishes and intentions of people like John F. Kennedy and
others.4-2 The lack of a standard nuclear reactor type. The
decentralized political system. The uninformed public. The antinuclear
lobby. A strict regulator. Political interference. Construction costs.
The list goes on. But central to most of the road blocks is a lack of
public awareness and fear of the unknown. 

Einstein was intensely aware of his role in the creation of the atom
bomb4-3, however indirect, but also of the benefits that this new
science entailed, whether it be medical breakthroughs or the generation
of electricity. To his horror his discoveries not only held great
promise harnessing of the atom for humanitarian benefits generating
electricity and providing isotopes for medicine but also the atom bomb.
In the quote above he is saying it’s what we do with technology that
becomes either destructive or beneficial. The choice is ours. Einstein
also has been quoted about the capacity of human stupidity and I’m sure
he would be sad to see how we have brought about climate change and its
twin tragedy ocean acidification (more on this later) and plethora of
other Earth maladies.

Our biggest problem is collective blindness. The willful ignorance is
frightening. In terms of the probability for self destruction, it need
not be nuclear weapons that destroys us, more likely, it will be our
contribution to these Earth illnesses that finishes the job. The path we
have taken is one of willful ignorance, neglect and indifference. As a
civilization we continue to behave in the manner to which we have become
accustomed, the same lifestyle that brought about climate change.
Summing it up, our attitude of neglect, wastefulness, selfish pursuits
of instant gratification, exploitation of resources, consumerism and
hedonism have had an impact that seriously threatens human existence.

The role humans have played in affecting climate change and ocean
acidification is pretty clear. We have all heard the warnings 4-4 and
shrugged off responsibility. It has taken us a while to recognize the
basic cause and effect of global warming. Mostly it is the direct result
of fossil fuel burning. We have been asleep at the wheel. The burning of
dirty coal is high on the list and transportation fuel not only produces
CO₂ but toxic substances and other greenhouse gases.

Also, burning gasoline and heating our homes with natural gas and oil
seem like innocent activities to most, but they also emit CO₂ and adds
up collectively. As a greenhouse gas CO₂ is accumulating the fastest and
is understood to be the most prevalent greenhouse gas. We are to blame
because we continue to use these fuels. They have contributed to the
constant building up of Carbon dioxide. CO₂ is the most plentiful of
various greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (over 400 parts per million).
The oceans have absorbed a lot of CO₂ acting as a buffer. The natural
ability of the oceans has prevented an otherwise much faster global
warming, and consequently a lowering of the ocean’s pH level. This
lowering of the ocean’s pH and global warming has begun the process of
massive sea life extinctions.

Awareness of the problem created by greenhouse gases is common knowledge
but news of the backlog and future effects have snuck up on us.

=== A CO₂ backlog?

Even if humans stopped causing CO₂ emissions today the existing excess
CO₂ and the backlog in the air and oceans would take centuries4-5 or
millenia to complete its natural cycle where it is returned to solid
form in the ground and ocean floor. If by some incredible cooperative
effort we somehow managed to stop burning stuff and stopped contributing
to the existing trillion tons of CO₂ not yet dissolved in the seas
tomorrow, the warming it causes will not stop. Stopping all combustion
would mean stopping coal and natural gas plants, commercial airlines,
automobiles, industrial processes that use combustion, even your reading
light by your bed could be powered by combustion if the energy comes
from coal. It is not good enough to cut back. A reversal is what’s
needed. All the coal, gasoline, coke, oil, biofuel, cement and steel
production require combustion and that is exactly what needs to stop.

But many of these processes could be sustainable if they used nuclear
power for electricity that would charge car batteries and the molten
salt reactor possibilities of industrial heat to produce low carbon fuel
and create better ways to accomplish common industrial activities.

=== Raise the alarm bells!

Some scientists warned us. In fact one scientist who will come back to
our story again. Alvin Weinberg, the inventor of the light water reactor
and the molten salt reactor, predicted that our over use of coal could
have serious consequences back in 1974.

The obvious early warning signs of the effects of climate and ocean
change are rising sea levels. Parts of New York city have started
flooding due to the constant rising. Sea levels have risen 70% more
rapidly since 1993.4-6

In a video news release President Obama spoke of his plans for attending
GLACIER4-7, a conference held Aug 30th, 2015.

``Climate change once seemed like a problem for future generations, but
for most Americans it’s already a reality – deeper droughts, longer
wildfire seasons, some of our cities even flood at high tide,'' he
said…In Alaska glaciers are melting… the hunting and fishing upon which
generation have depended for a way of life and their jobs are being
threatened."

But the politicians are still playing politics. They can count on the
fact that the public does not fully understand how extreme the problem
has become. It is right to take action, but the size of the problem
continues to be swept under the carpet. U.S. diplomacy has failed in
winning allies regarding fighting climate change. Stating that the
problem is serious, and then proposing countermeasures that amount to
very little is a typical political maneuver. Politicians fear a
pandora’s box, too big to confront and not within the scope of even one
election cycle. To be set on a course of extreme action is just too big
an issue for any future political leader to dare handle. However we have
seen in the 2020 election campaign a more daring election platform
pushing for both election reform and a promise to implement nuclear
energy by Andrew Yang and Cory Booker. Biden is the only choice. If
climate change is to be taken seriously then nuclear energy must be a
platform issue.

James Hansen of NASA Godard Institute for Space Studies started
officially recording global temperatures on 1981. His most well known
testimony before congress in 1988 did the most to raise awareness of
global warming. He also wrote a paper in 2003 called ``Can We Defuse the
Global Warming Time Bomb?''4-8

=== How We Measure Success

Most people would agree that technologically we, as a civilization, have
come a long way. But if we were to measure how much of a difference any
particular technology has made to our lives, nuclear technology might be
the greatest of them all.

The engineers who designed and built the first nuclear reactors learned
to apply science that was based on layers of engineering in many
disciplines never seen before. They built the ultimate machine that
could transform a ``rock'' into immense power. Power that could be
extended, controlled and sustained for decades refueling once a year
with some designs (i.e. CANDU) that never needed to shut down4-9 during
refueling. The largest plants are strong enough to supply all the
electricity needs of an average city. That rock was no ordinary rock.
Some of the proposed 4th generation reactors we will see next decade
will only need refueling every 4-7 years.4-10

The irony is that the same science that led to the atom bomb is the same
science that could lead to a solution that saves us. We already know
that nuclear medicine is a field that has saved millions. Nuclear power
plants have been a very important substitute for polluting coal plants.
That alone goes a very long way to providing part of the solution. The
atomic age is here but not nearly at the level it could be. The science
of using uranium for bombs and the science of using uranium for creating
energy are two distantly related and very distinct disciplines. We can’t
let our fear of nuclear bombs affect our path forward with nuclear power
and nuclear medicine. (See Chapter Fourteen)

==== Effects of Resource Wars

When you compare spending on defense and military between countries we
can see that most of the biggest countries feel the need to protect
their sovereignty. The US spends trillions on defense, spending that
could otherwise go far towards solving the energy crisis for example or
replacing coal with nuclear. The misguided funding of the government
military and defense sucks the life out of the economy and the competing
government departments who get stuck with comparably pitiful amounts.

==== Overcoming Irrational Fear

The way James Lovelock describes the fear is that nuclear radiation is
mistakenly connected to cancer4-11. We have all witnessed the effects of
the disease. We live with a contradiction and most of us have witnessed
that radiation can even cure cancer. We have been told it can cause
cancer but, in truth, not so easily.  Our bodies have evolved from a
time when radiation was even greater than we now deal with in our modern
daily existence. Remember that we have radiation around us all of the
time. Our bodies deal with far more chemical assaults than radiation
assaults. In fact many scientists have concluded that radiation below a
certain level is actually beneficial. The common items we come in
contact with daily do not harm us even though they emit radiation.

Things like bananas (any foods with potassium), granite, marble, the
sky, the sun, the earth, the sand on the beach, the ocean we swim in all
have radiation. You remember the nuclear bomb tests that took place in
the ocean, the air, underground? (Some exceptions of course took place
but even expert Richard Rhodes says its the fires that do the most
harm4-12) But, how is it possible that we have not had massive illnesses
from radiation exposure to fallout? The reason is that the radiation is
diluted to levels that we already routinely deal with on a daily basis
so it has no consequence.  This is also true of rarely occurring nuclear
accidents. In fact coal plants are far worse. Coal emits all kinds of
toxins including, you guessed it, radiation. Keep in mind radiation has
a halflife. It disappears eventually. The chemicals like mercury,
sulphur and arsenic that are emitted by coal plants are forever.  

==== Innocence to Disillusionment

A lot happened in nuclear science while we were not looking (See
Benefits of Nuclear Science in Chapter Twelve). It does raise some
questions. What happened? What caused the industry to forge ahead
scientifically without making the science and mathematics more
accessible? How did the public’s grasp on the science become so distant?

Our fears have affected the outcome of the dream of an atomic age4-13.
Even the medical world has been affected by the attitude towards nuclear
plants. Such a slowdown was triggered by unfortunate circumstances. As a
result of misunderstood mechanical failures in two nuclear plants (three
if you count the more recent Fukushima) the industry became heavily
regulated, over politicized and over scrutinized in an already
over-regulated industry.

=== The Boomers

The 1950s expanded and ushered in a real consumer and commercial age. It
was a baby boom era that created a market frenzy that flaunted the
products and lifestyle of the American dream. Images of stay-at-home
housewives and the working husband became a frequent part of the ads in
magazines and on sponsored television. Symbols of prosperity, innocence
and hope clashed with those of the civil rights movement  and the witch
hunts against communists.

The depiction of the Russian adversary in films and news about a growing
arms race heightened the fears. The rapid scientific advancement and
military expansion on both sides as well as attempts to justify
aggression both abroad and against the so-called communist sympathizers
produced deep psychological damage that would have repercussions in more
than just America. The Middle East, Korea and Vietnam all became the
stage to play out the drama of building American military might and the
policing of the free world against communist expansion.

=== Lessons Learned?

A lot of traditional values slipped away when mass media started to
dominate our daily routine. At first it felt good economically because
people had plenty of disposable income. But a lot started to change as
the period of innocence gave way to cynicism. We started to recognize
hypocrisy. We had been raised on a phony ideal. What was labeled the
``me'' generation emerged. Divorces skyrocketed and children with single
parents became quite common.

The ideal of being wholesome, law abiding and self sacrificing was the
message coming from the establishment as to the best path to follow, but
after experiencing a lack of similar sentiments in return we began to
feel betrayed. The preaching and the doing has not been consistent. It
has eroded our confidence in the system. But the system is supposed to
be democratic. Do we let democracy perform as it should? How might our
wishes be better represented? More on this later.

==== What Stifled Progress?

In order to see how silence, secrecy and the Cold War we need to go back
to the root of the problem which produced a generation of anti nuclear
citizens. It began with the second world war, the Manhattan Project
(1939-1946). It was a project to develop the atomic  bomb. Done in
secret, the best scientists from around the world were assembled.

How it happened and why it happened is generally understood. It was
wartime. But that secrecy is what drove a wedge between public
understanding and scientific advancement.

A great deal was accomplished in those few years. A very large body of
scientific discovery was known by only a limited number of people and
kept secret for several decades.

Glenn Seaborg had started to report on the properties of thorium and
uranium in 1939. His big breakthroughs in 1942 were with thorium and
plutonium. Seaborg knew that he had made a startling discovery and saw
its potential for powering electricity for peaceful purposes. But his
discovery that Thorium could create Uranium 233 was overshadowed by his
discovery of Plutonium.

Thorium had the promise of being used for peaceful purposes but the bomb
fuel, plutonium, became the focus till after the war. Thorium became the
motivating purpose for the molten salt reactor over a decade later under
Alvin Weinberg’s Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE).

Ironically the military quest intervened once more in the late 40s when
it was requested that a nuclear powered airplane be designed.

The years following the 2nd World War were generally positive about the
prospects of an atomic age. The public had visions of a very modern and
affordable future. But the contingent of an uncertain future with an
aggressive Russian leadership kept the US military leadership on a
continuous R&D effort to hold onto its military advantage. The next goal
was the Nuclear Energy Powered Aircraft  (NEPA) under General Curtis. He
had commanded the bomber attacks on Japan during the war. Conceptually
the idea was to be able to keep a nuclear bomber aircraft airborne
indefinitely, unrestricted by fuel limitations. There were several
designs being considered. The idea was tested for a short time and it
was dropped and picked up again later.

Weinberg had a long standing position as administrator at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory from 1945 to 1973. Just like many of his colleagues
he had worked on the Manhattan Project.

In Weinberg’s The First Nuclear Era he says ``as I think back on
Wigner’s design of the Hanford plutonium-producing reactors, I can think
of only one analogy: Mozart, who would compose a piano concerto in a few
days. The whole thing was accomplished in about four months…the entire
conception was mind-boggling- a chain-reacting pile producing 500
megawatts at a time when no one had operated a critical pile at any
power… we can hardly imagine the sense of strangeness that pervaded the
enterprise in 1942.''

A smaller reactor was now being considered for flight. Weinberg knew it
was not a smart idea for a few reasons but he welcomed a chance to
develop the technology to become a better reactor than his first
invention the Light Water Reactor (LWR) which eventually became a huge
success on submarines and aircraft carriers and eventually civilian
commercial reactors.

Since the light water reactor had been declared too heavy for flight a
new design was requested and that is when the MSRE was born. What was
called the Thorium cycle that produced 233U had been determined to be
unsuitable for nuclear weapons.

But the design concept was radically different from any previous
reactors. The fuel was blended with a molten salt mixture and it so
happens that uranium 233 was the fuel of choice but prepared in a
separate research reactor. The eventual development of thorium
processing would depend on getting the green light to develop a
commercial reactor. The thorium cycle produced 233U, a fuel much less
desirable for weapons, and it held the promise of a cheaper to build,
more efficient and even safer reactor. Alvin Weinberg’s focus on reactor
safety and his strong preference for the molten salt reactor designs
went against the more favored nuclear design, the Light Water Reactor.
It was what led to his being fired.

Much of the library at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) consists of
thousands of pages that remained classified until the 1990s. This whole
field of science had stayed secret while a new generation of engineers
and scientists knew very little about it. Glenn Seaborg referred to the
secrecy of the time as ``small islands of technical information sealed
off from the rest of society.''

In a book titled ``Neutron’s Children: Nuclear Engineers and the shaping
of identity'' Sean F. Johnston states ``Previous studies of secrecy in
the nuclear field have focused on those vocal and visible members of the
`atomic scientists movement' who actively promoted internationalism and
progressive ideals during the post-war period, or on contemporary
weapons designers. By contrast, the effects of secrecy on their cousins
the engineers, technicians, and other skilled nuclear specialists, who
arguably were even more affected, kept them relatively voiceless and
unexamined.'' … ``Like medieval monasteries, wartime and post-war
national laboratories in the USA, UK and Canada promoted distinct
regional variations, they were not founded primarily with economic
motivations, but on locally nuanced and isolated intellectual
foundations; they combined idealism with pragmatic duties; and they
served a strong central authority.''

The knowledge gained from developing and processing the fuel for weapons
during those early war years prepared the way for commercial reactors.
But the secrecy caused a gap in understanding which led to  the myths
about nuclear energy and atomic science. This grew into a backlash that
prevented us from benefitting from the full potential that nuclear
technologies capability promised.

The quest for military power and the propaganda machine was certainly an
obstacle. Various leaders and men in positions of power took on roles
that were strategic for developing a superior military force and
providing a technical knowledge that unintentionally became a part of a
knowledge resource for positive change. President Harry Truman back in
1946 wanted nuclear research out of the hands of the armed forces and
switched to civilian hands. This was a controversial issue and remained
a divisive issue for decades to come. The  Eisenhower years also started
an initiative around the need for expanding nuclear energy with the
Atoms for Peace program. Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Reagan had positive
outlooks for nuclear energy. But not enough to stay the course.

There were other factors, such as the hubris that accompanies any
specialized field, that played a role in causing the delay of nuclear
science advances reaching the public as well as contributing to a
growing mistrust of scientists.

Science has grown and fragmented into an unimaginable number of fields
and specialties. This trend has blossomed to a point where any member of
the public is challenged to keep up. But energy is fundamental just like
food and money. So the basics of energy need to be learned early. Now
more than ever nuclear energy must play a role in restoring Earth to an
ecological balance.

In light of this we need to understand what other obstacles also
prevented acceptance of nuclear energy. These obstacles have their roots
in anti nuclear groups and individuals. The original antinuclear groups
never confused the two technologies of nuclear weapons and nuclear
energy. They simply wanted to ban the bomb. But with growing consumerism
and personal possessions adding two or more cars per household began to
make the oil companies very wealthy. They were so huge and wealthy that
they made the nuclear companies seem commercially insignificant. But for
the oil companies it was the prospect of nuclear energy taking some of
their valued business away.

So joining the propaganda effort were the corporations who saw nuclear
energy as a threat. On one hand you had the propaganda justifying the
war machine and on the other you had a rationale designed to slow down
or stop nuclear energy in order to ensure continued profits from oil and
coal.

In conclusion a lot of the blame for the sins against the environment
sits with corporate greed, the military complex and the growing gap
between the public and scientific community. We can begin to see that
turning a blind eye to important trends had repercussions. To ignore the
warnings of people like Alvin Weinberg who wanted a better nuclear
reactor that was potentially cheaper and safer and therefore more able
to bring on the atomic era was a sensible vision in retrospect. Knowing
that climate was changing was not a major concern for very many.

=== Walk the Walk, Talk the Talk

We have had it lucky in North America. We have been the envy of many
nations. Our comforts seem to have come easily. Credit goes to the
engineers and designers for their clever innovations and inventions. But
still, we are spoiled with energy.

Most people take energy for granted. The first big lesson we need to
learn is getting a sense of what it’s like to have energy poverty. We
understand very well what it’s like to have energy wealth. Televisions,
computers, stereos, microwave ovens, dishwashers, giant freezers,
heating, air conditioning, battery chargers and the list goes on and on.
If you live in a city you have traffic lights, sports bars running eight
or more giant TV screens with different games being broadcast,
elevators, escalators, coffee makers, electric trains, electric pumps to
send water into all those high rise buildings and the list goes on.

The United States and Canada have been the biggest energy consumers in
the world per capita. According to World Bank4-14:

Equivalent of Gallons of oil/yr/capita. (2011)

US - 7,000 (Canada slightly higher)

China - 2,000

India -  600

The metric tons/yr/capita of carbon dioxide emissions:

US 17

China 7

India 2

In the next 20 years power demand in developing countries is expected to
increase by more than 250%, in industrialized countries, however, only
by 37%. That’s a growth rate of more than double for developing
countries and not much more than a third for localities in North
America.

Per capita energy consumption for India shows you what energy poverty
looks  like. Blackouts and brownouts are normal in India but even more
common is no electricity at all.

Blackouts are pretty common across the U.S. as well. Facts on blackouts
from Issues in Science and Technology magazine:

“The average U.S. customer loses power for 214 minutes per year. That
compares to 70 in the United Kingdom, 53 in France, 29 in the
Netherlands, 6 in Japan, and 2 minutes per year in Singapore. These
outage durations tell only part of the story. In Japan, the average
customer loses power once every 20 years. In the United States, it is
once every 9 months, excluding hurricanes and other strong storms.

Despite decades of sober technical reports written by investigation
teams in the aftermath of blackouts, the frequency of electric power
outages in the United States is no less today than it was a
quarter-century ago. Whether measured in terms of city-sized blackouts
or smaller events, the statistics show that reliability has not
improved. Indeed, if the data shows any trend in the past few years, it
is toward lower reliability.

The causes of outages in the United States show there is considerable
room for improvement. If outages from major storms are excluded, the
causes of each hour of outage include equipment failure (24 minutes), as
in the 1965 Northeast blackout; untrimmed trees near power lines (6
minutes); and mistakes by power company personnel (4 minutes), as in the
1977 New York blackout and the 2005 Los Angeles outage. This history of
blackouts creates ample public demand to increase reliability, opening a
window of opportunity for the industry4-15."

=== Quick Facts

Government has always played a role in energy supply. This is a handy
list to keep when accusations fly about expensive nuclear power getting
subsidies:

The components of a wind turbine are not as clean as you imagine.

* 200-378 Tonnes of steel
* 1 tonne of coal used to make 1 tonne of steel (we know coal kills)
* 1000 tons of concrete for the base
* 200 kg of coal per tonne of cement
* 200 tonnes of coal for the concrete base
* 400 tonnes or more of coal for a single wind turbine
* 131 tonnes of coal kills one person
* before the windmill even begins to operate it has effectively killed 3
people based on how much coal is used to complete.(my own calculation)
* for the same amount of electricity produced, wind turbines require 50
times more steel and 60 times more concrete than nuclear reactors.
* Seven hundred lbs of coal will keep a 100 watt light bulb glowing for
a year
* A ball of thorium the size of a golf ball can supply one person’s
energy needs for a lifetime.(assuming it is a molten salt reactor)
* One ton of natural uranium can produce more than 40 million
kilowatt-hours of electricity. This is equivalent to burning 16,000 tons
of coal or 80,000 barrels of oil.
