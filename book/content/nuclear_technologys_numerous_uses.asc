== Nuclear Technology’s Numerous Uses

This is the 2004 article by Alan E. Waltar (alan.waltar@pnl.gov) who was
director of nuclear energy at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Washington. Original article was published in ``Issues in
Science and Technology, Vol. XX, No. 3, Spring 2004''

We should not letunjustified fear of radiation createobstacles to
continued progressand benefits.

In his 1953 ``Atoms for Peace'' address to the United Nations, President
Dwight D. Eisenhower challenged scientists and engineers to harness the
atom for humanitarian purposes in medicine, agriculture, and other
non-power aspects of direct benefit. Half a century later, nuclear
technology has had astounding economic and job impacts in the United
States (see Table 1). The totals in terms of dollars and jobs are
impressive, but perhaps the biggest revelation is that the atom has a
substantially larger impact outside the nuclear power sector than in it.

Perhaps the most significant success story over the past half-century in
harnessing radiation to serve modern humanity is found in the field of
medicine.

Sterilizing medical equipment. Radiation in high enough doses can kill
microorganisms, so gamma radiation is used to sterilize dressings,
surgical gloves, bandages, and other equipment routinely used during
medical procedures. Today, well over half of all sterilized medical
equipment used in modern U.S. hospitals has had radiation treatment.
This is safer and cheaper than most other methods (such as steam)
because it can be done after the item is packaged. Its sterile shelf
life is practically infinite as long as the package is not opened.

New drug testing. Substantial testing must be done before new drugs are
approved. This includes detecting how a product attacks a targeted
disease and any possible side effects. Radioisotopes, because of their
unique imaging characteristics (via particle emission), are ideally
suited to deal with such questions–including material uptake,
metabolism, distribution, and elimination of unwanted residues from the
body. For at least 80 percent of the new drugs approved by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for medical use in the United States,
radiation was a crucial component of their success in making it through
the approval process. The International Atomic Energy Agency estimates
that some 100 to 300 radiopharmaceuticals are in routine use throughout
the world, and most are commercially available.

Diagnostic techniques. The earliest use of radiation in the medical
field occurred in World War I, when portable x-rays helped field
surgeons save many lives. Today, dental x-rays, chest x-rays,
mammograms, and numerous other tests are used routinely in the medical
and dental professions.

But x-rays, useful as they are, provide only a snapshot of a particular
piece of the anatomy. The imaging properties of radioisotopes allow
modern nuclear medical specialists to measure the activity of some
specific physiological or biochemical function in the body as a function
of time. Two of the most common technologies are single photon emission
computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET),
which are used to detect cancer. Nuclear diagnostic techniques are now
routinely used throughout the industrial world to determine anomalies in
the heart, brain, kidneys, lungs, liver, breasts, and thyroid glands.
Bone and joint disorders, along with spinal disorders, also benefit
directly from this routine use of radioisotopes.

Therapeutic approaches. Until recently, the use of radiation to actually
cure diseases was rather limited. One of the first therapeutic
applications involved using iodine-131 (¹³¹I) to cure thyroid cancer.
Since the thyroid has a special affinity for iodine, it is a relatively
simple and straightforward matter to have a patient drink a carefully
determined amount of ¹³¹I in a chemically palatable form of solution.
The ¹³¹I then preferentially lodges in the thyroid gland, and the
beta-emitting properties of this radioisotope subsequently target and
destroy the thyroid malignancy. Since ¹³¹I has a half-life of eight
days, it effectively disappears within a few weeks. Radiation is now
used widely in the treatment of other cancers as well.

Most of the current therapeutic procedures deliver radiation to the
patient externally. Accelerators are used to deliver either protons to
the target or beta particles, which are normally directed onto a target
that secondarily produces x-rays. Although this can have substantial
benefits, it is impossible to keep the radiation from killing or
impairing healthy tissue in the immediate vicinity, especially if the
beam must pass through healthy tissue to reach the malignancy.

aUsing a multipliciative economic model that includes secondary revenue
and jobs created by the primary source

There are three principal ways to minimize injury to healthy cells from
radiation therapy: (1) rotating the external beam around the patient,
(2) creating radioisotopes only at the site of the malignancy, and (3)
developing a method to deliver appropriate radioisotopes directly to the
cancerous tissue.

An example of the first approach is the ``gamma knife,'' where the
radioactive source is delivered from many directions, with the beam
continuously focused on the targeted abnormality but with only small
amounts of radiation passing through healthy tissue.

An example of the second approach is boron-neutron capture therapy.
Boron is introduced into the patient as part of a special chemical
carrier, so that it preferentially concentrates at the tumor site. A
neutron beam is then focused on the boron, producing alpha particles
that destroy the malignant cells only in the immediate vicinity of the
concentrated boron. Because alpha particles are typically stopped within
one human cell from their point of origin, the intense radiation damage
is quite localized.

An example of the third approach is cell-directed radiation therapy. In
order to have just localized damage, either beta or alpha emitters are
needed. For solid tumors, one method of getting the radioisotope to the
target is direct injection, assuming that the tumor is accessible.
Brachytherapy, for instance, is used to treat prostate cancer: Several
``seeds,'' each containing a small amount of a radionuclide such as I125
or palladium-103 within a titanium capsule about the size of a grain of
rice, are placed directly into the prostate gland, where they remain for
life. Another cell-directed method involves attaching the radioisotope
to a chemical that has a special affinity for the malignancy. This is
called the monoclonal antibody (or ``smart bullet'') approach. It is
particularly suited for treating malignancies that are not confined to a
particular spot, such as leukemia and non-Hodgkin’s disease.

Although many of these therapeutic applications of radiation are still
in relatively early trial stages, the potential for success is enormous.

AGRICULTURE

There remains a huge need to find new ways to increase food production
and deliver food without spoilage to the growing global population.

Greater crop production. By attaching radioactive tracers to known
quantities and varieties of fertilizers, it is possible to directly
determine nutrient efficiencies as the labeled products are absorbed at
critical locations in the plant. This can help to substantially reduce
the amount of fertilizer required to produce robust yields.

Water is becoming quite scarce in many areas of the world. Neutron
moisture gauges can measure the hydrogen component of water in both the
plant and the surrounding soil. Thus, they are ideal instruments to help
farmers make the best use of limited water supplies and are now found on
many large U.S. farms.

Another effective way to improve crop production is the development of
new species–varieties that can better withstand heat or storm damage,
have earlier maturing times to escape frost damage and allow crop
rotation, resist diseases and droughts, provide better growth and yield
patterns, deliver improved nutritional value, allow improved processing
quality, and so on.

Specialized radiation techniques–either directly bombarding seeds to
alter DNA structures or irradiating crops to induce variations in the
resulting seeds–can greatly accelerate the selection process. Radiation
was the key element in the development of 89 percent of about 2,250 new
crop varieties in the past 70 years; three-quarters of these
irradiation-induced varieties were food crops, and the rest were
ornamental flowers.

To date, China has benefited the most from using radiation to improve
crop species. As of 2002, nearly 27 percent of the crops grown in China
were developed this way. The equivalent figure elsewhere ranges from
11.5 percent in India and 9.3 percent in Russia to 7.8 percent in the
Netherlands, 5.7 percent in the United States, and 5.3 percent in Japan.
Indeed, the application of radiation techniques to the development of
new crop varieties has probably provided the greatest global economic
value of any form of harnessing radiation.

Improving Animal Health. Farm animals have likewise benefited from the
application of radiation techniques. One key area concerns the optimal
use of natural pastures or commercially prepared feeds. This is
accomplished by labeling feed with specialty radioisotopes, such as
carbon-14, and then tracing the paths of the food within the animal’s
digestive system to determine where and how quickly it is broken down
into body tissues or milk. This helps determine food’s nutritional
value.

Radioisotopes have also been used to develop vaccines that are effective
against certain animal diseases. For example, rinderpest (``cattle
plague'')–a dreaded disease that has killed millions of cattle on
African farms over the past four decades–has been eliminated using
radiation-produced vaccinations in 16 of the 18 African countries
previously infested.

Eradication of pests. One proven way to use nuclear technology in
controlling or even eradicating unwanted insects is the sterile insect
technique. This involves mass ``factory breeding'' of large numbers of
the target insects and sterilizing the males by exposing them to gamma
irradiation. When the sterilized males are released into infested areas
and mate with wild females, no offspring are produced; if the sterilized
males greatly outnumber the wild males in the area, the pest will be
eradicated. Perhaps the largest success to date in using this technique
occurred in Mexico.

The Mediterranean fruit fly (the medfly) was knocked out entirely by
1981, and a screwworm eradication program yielded some $3 billion in
benefits to the Mexican economy by 1991.

Food processing. Tragically, infestation and spoilage prevent one-fourth
to one-half of the food produced in the world from reaching people. In
addition, the food that does reach them can become unsafe to eat because
of contaminants such as insects, molds, and bacteria. The U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 1999 that some 5,000
Americans die each year from food-borne diseases, and about 30 million
others become sick, with about 300,000 of them requiring
hospitalization.

Food irradiation involves subjecting food to carefully controlled
amounts of ionizing radiation, such as beta particles or gamma rays, to
break the DNA bonds of targeted pathogens. This is especially effective
in destroying the reproductive cycle of bacteria and pathogens. It can
eradicate unwanted organisms and specific non­spore-forming pathogenic
microorganisms such as salmonella. It can also interfere with
physiological processes such as sprouting in potatoes or onions. Thus
the shelf life of many foods can be extended appreciably, and the
presence of food-borne disease organisms such as Escherichia coli can be
dramatically reduced. It is important to note that food processed by
radiation does not become radioactive. At the doses used, it is
impossible for beta, gamma, or x-rays to make food radioactive.

One of the prime advantages of food irradiation is that it sterilizes
food without altering its form or taste. Older methods of food
processing, which rely on heating or freezing, extreme drying or
salting, or chemical treatments, generally do change the way food tastes
and/or looks.

Widespread acceptance of food irradiation by the general public has been
slow, but there are several signs–particularly in the United States–that
consumer acceptance is not far away. Major supermarkets have signed on
to offer irradiated meat at some stores. And the 2002 Farm Bill approved
by Congress mandated that commodities such as meat and poultry that are
treated by any technology approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
and the FDA for improving food safety must be made available to the
National School Lunch Program. Food irradiation is included in this
mandate.

INDUSTRY

Although modern factories are the source of most of the products that we
use daily, harnessed radiation in industry likely constitutes the most
hidden use of this technology to ordinary citizens.

Process control and plant diagnostics. Because radiation has the ability
to penetrate matter, industrial measurements can be made using
radioisotopes without direct physical contact with either the source or
the sensor. This allows online measurements to be made nondestructively
while the material being measured is in motion. Measurements that are
typically made in production lines include liquid levels, the density of
materials in vessels and pipelines, the thickness of sheets and
coatings, and the amounts and properties of materials on conveyor belts.

Radioisotope ``thickness gauges'' are unequalled in performance and are
used extensively in almost every industry involved in producing sheet
material (such as sheet metal or paper). It is highly unlikely that
automation in such industries would be possible without the use of
radioisotopes. Modern steel mills use such gauges to measure the
thickness of rolled metals accurately at every moment during production.
Paper mills use them to measure the density of wet pulp accurately in
the first stages of paper production. These gauges are also frequently
used in the food industry (such as in filling cereal boxes) and the oil
industry, where determining the density of liquids, solids, or slurries
is important.

Many radioactive tracer techniques have been used to investigate the
reasons for reduced efficiency in modern plant operations. Tracers are
now routinely used to measure flow rates, study mixing patterns, and
locate leaks in heat exchangers and pipelines.

Materials development. Changes in molecular structure, including the
inducement of desired chemical reactions, can be created in certain
materials by appropriate exposure to radiation. For example, some
polymers whose cross-linkage is induced by radiation can be tailored to
shrink when heated. ``Heat-shrink'' products are now widely used in the
packaging industry. Wire and cable insulated with radiation-cross-linked
polyvinylchloride exhibit excellent resistance to heat and chemical
attack and are widely used in the automobile, aerospace, and
telecommunications industries. This process is being used increasingly
to cross-link foamed polyethylene for thermal insulation and
wood/plastic composites cured by gamma irradiation. The latter are
gaining favor for flooring in department stores, airports, hotels, and
churches because of their excellent abrasion resistance, the beauty of
natural grains, and low maintenance costs. Many tire companies are now
using radiation to vulcanize rubber for tire production as an
improvement over the conventional use of sulfur.

Materials testing and inspection. One of the earliest industrial
applications of radiation was to measure engine wear in the automotive
industry. Irradiating the surface of an engine part under investigation
(such as a ring or a gear) makes that portion of the metal radioactive.
In tests to see which materials hold up best during operation, any wear
on that part results in some radioactive material being deposited in the
oil lubrication stream, where it can be readily measured.

Corrosion in pipes is a common problem in the industrial world. By
moving a gamma source on one side of the pipe and a detector on the
other, precise analyses can be made of the corrosion patterns. The
activation property of radiation is used extensively to determine
precise layers of special coatings, such as metal coatings to produce
galvanized or tin-plated steel. The penetrating property of radiation is
routinely used to check welds in crucial places such as airplane wings,
housings for jet engines, and oil and gas pipelines.

Police and firefighters should be trained to deal with the real dangers
of nuclear materials rather than perceived ones.

Energy The coal industry benefits directly from using neutron gauges to
measure and control the moisture content in coal and coke. And gamma
sources are used to assay ash content as well as the combustion gases
that go up the stack. It is important to determine the sulfur and
nitrogen contents of coal, which are of considerable interest because of
their contributions to acid rain. A new radiation technique called
electron beam processing has been developed to remove both sulfur and
nitrogen oxides from flue gas effectively and allow the products to be
converted into a commercially viable agricultural fertilizer.

The oil industry also depends heavily on the use of radiation to conduct
business. Borehole logging often employs nuclear probes to determine the
potential for economically viable oil deposits in test wells. Radiation
monitors are also widely used to determine malfunctions in refinery
operations.

Personal care and conveniences. Anyone who wears either contact lenses
or glasses benefits directly from radiation. The saline solution used to
clean and store contact lenses is sterilized by gamma radiation. Neutron
probes are used to ensure the proper moisture content during the making
of the high-quality glass for eyeglasses. Cosmetics often use gamma
radiation to rid products of any microbes before the product is packaged
for public consumption. One helpful feature of radiation is that it
changes the molecular structure of some materials to allow them to
absorb huge amounts of liquid. Useful products that rely on this include
air fresheners, disposable diapers, and tampons.

OTHER FIELDS

Radiation has an increasing role in public safety, including airport
screening, crime solving, and the deterrence of terrorism at points of
entry. The use of americum-241 in smoke detectors has undoubtedly saved
thousands of lives and prevented untold property damage.

Radiation is also a key component for archaeological dating and the
enhancement of precious gems. It is likewise used extensively for
measuring and controlling sources of contamination to our environment.

Advanced space exploration would not be possible without radiation
technology. Plutonium-238 is widely used as both a heat source to keep
instruments from freezing and a source of electricity to run instruments
and communication devices. Propulsion that uses nuclear-reactor rockets
will be needed for manned voyages to other planets or their moons.

Finally, radiation technology provides a powerful fleet of tools to
probe and unravel the mysteries of the basic structure of materials.
From electron microscopes to very-high-energy accelerators, researchers
have one of the best sets of technologies available to both explore
existing matter and to synthesize new materials with highly desirable
properties.

OBSTACLES TO FURTHER PROGRESS

It is not a given that these impressive applications of nuclear
technology will continue to expand. The public’s sometimes overriding
fear of radiation has historically thwarted progress in many areas.

This fear has worked its way into numerous rules and regulations among
federal and state agencies that have stymied progress and added
considerable cost in several areas. For instance, the intense degree of
regulation of almost anything having a nuclear component forces
practitioners to use time-consuming and expensive accounting practices.
Is the cost of such detailed recordkeeping really warranted when the
expense of such attention to detail is ultimately passed on to the
public? Some medical practitioners have reacted by moving into other
areas of practice.

Perhaps a larger issue facing the nuclear medical industry is the
disposition of low-level radioactive waste (LLW). There are currently
only two U.S. sites licensed to receive this waste material: Richland,
Washington, and Barnwell, South Carolina. Efforts to dispose of LLW in
other areas have met strong public resistance, even though detailed
scientific studies have shown such sites and associated operations to be
much safer than essentially any other waste commodity. As a result,
long-distance hauling of LLW from hundreds, if not thousands, of sites
clearly adds to the cost of waste disposal today and hence to the cost
of using this technology.

A significant impediment to the medical community is the limited
availability of new radioisotopes. Currently, the United States imports
at least 90 percent of the radioisotopes used in daily commerce.
Further, the U.S. Department of Energy has reduced its research budget
for producing and developing the use of new radioisotopes to zero. Some
clinical studies to use new radioisotopes in curing cancer and other
life-limiting diseases have been halted because of the lack of isotopes.
Of perhaps greater concern, there are very few sources of alpha
emitters, which have enormous potential for curing several types of
cancer. Without a major change to revitalize the U.S. radioisotope
program, nuclear medicine could stagnate. New techniques such as gene
therapy will likely play an increasing role in the future, but even
these often require the concurrent use of radiation technology in order
to be successful.

Concern over radiation dangers is also thwarting progress in areas other
than medicine. A classic case is food irradiation. This technology has
been studied for more than four decades in several countries and has
been declared safe and effective by essentially every relevant
international scientific body. Yet only recently have U.S. federal
approvals been given for its use on major food items. Irradiated foods
sold in bulk, such as chicken or strawberries, are designated with the
``radura'' symbol on the package. Approval of the irradiation of seafood
commodities is still pending, but efforts to gain it are under way. This
is important because spoilage is quite high for many of these products.
In a less visible aspect of agriculture, many thousands of acres of
stubble are burned every year to cleanse fields of insects and other
undesirable pests; gamma irradiation might provide a better
soil-cleansing operation.

Even though radioisotopes are widely used in industry for gauges, the
automation of processing, the manufacture of new materials, and so on,
there is still reluctance in some quarters to use radiation because of
concern that the public may be unwilling to accept products from a
company utilizing radiation technology.

The U.S. space program has stagnated somewhat over the past decade or
two because policymakers have been exceptionally cautious about
developing nuclear propulsion engines. Fears of minute quantities of
radioactive materials falling back to Earth after a mishap in space have
sometimes overshadowed the fact that deep space exploration with sizable
payloads simply cannot be accomplished without nuclear propulsion. The
United States has launched only one nuclear reactor into space to date,
but there are now plans to build and launch a substantially larger
reactor as a key part of the Jupiter Icy Moon project.

Since the 9/11 tragedy, public fears have risen about terrorists’
possible use of a radiation dispersal device (RDD) or ``dirty bomb.''
Although this is clearly possible, the actual health effects from such a
detonation would almost certainly be far less than imagined by a
frightened public. Several scores of radioisotopes are being used to
supply the benefits described throughout this article, but only a
handful of radioisotopes pose a real potential hazard in an RDD. Hence,
it is important that police and firefighters be trained to deal with
real dangers rather than perceived ones, so that unnecessary panic does
not take place if someone threatens to use such a device or actually
sets one off.

It is clear that President Eisenhower’s challenge to use the atom for
peace has been ably met. The benefits achieved over the past 50 years
are nothing short of astonishing. One out of every three patients who
enter a U.S. hospital or medical clinic, for instance, benefits directly
from nuclear medicine. This translates into over 10 million nuclear
medical procedures per year. Even broader beneficial impacts are
possible, such as the successful adoption of food irradiation in normal
commerce.

But there are significant obstacles to overcome whenever radiation is
used, mainly because of lingering public fears. Perhaps the most
significant success that the scientific community could strive for in
this field in the next 50 years is to effectively engage the public and
political leaders in a dialogue to eliminate unnecessary fears of
radiation. Making people more aware of the enormous daily benefits of
radiation is an important first step. If we could accomplish this, the
dream of a better world that President Eisenhower set before us could be
achieved many times over.
