== Perception Versus Reality

If we try to stay current with what’s going on in the world we find
ourselves constantly faced with the task of sorting out how others fail
to see reality. But of course, depending on your sources, getting to the
truth is harder than ever because within the explosion of information
that’s available, there is a deluge of misinformation. But, finding the
full truth can set you free. I will limit my writing to my own personal
experiences.

A big eye opener I had, not too long ago, was in a Facebook chat with a
passionate young man who called himself a human rights activist. I was
trying to persuade him that Ontario’s energy bills were higher because
of subsidies for renewables such as wind and solar. He was clearly very
smart and articulate. Still, he disagreed.

He wanted to inform me that nuclear energy was bad because the uranium
mining10-1 it required was doing harm to the environment. His take on it
was that nuclear power was run by the big bad corporations and that they
were interested in profits at the expense of the people, especially the
first nations people. I could not help but wonder if his point of view
was outdated. I knew for instance that there is only one uranium mine
still functioning in Canada and that is Cameco in Saskatchewan. I
explained to him about the enormous benefit Ontario experiences as a
result of our nuclear plants and that the good that nuclear plants do,
far outweighs the harm the mining does.

Later, after digging more into the subject I discovered that mines and
power plants have consequences and their proximity to valued natural
habitat going back just 25 years has a dark history with regard to the
wishes of the First Nations people. Consultation has been missing from
the process of establishing mining and power plant operations.

As recent as 50 years ago consultation with First Nations, Inuit and
Métis regarding mining activities was nonexistent. There has been a
significant improvement, especially in recent years. For example there
are clear indications from Ontario Power Group (OPG) that dialogue has
improved. The world’s biggest uranium mines are in Kazahkstan, Canada
and Australia. Canada’s worst health impacts to the indigenous people go
back to the 1930s right up to 1962 in Deline, Northwest Territories.

It is a violation when you show up in someones backyard uninvited. It is
invasive when you start digging without permission and without any
attempt to educate the people about the dangers or benefits. All of that
has changed and the rules were laid out in 1995. Now that protocols have
been established and consultation has been started. What needs to be
communicated more often is that the benefits of uranium mining and
nuclear energy far outweigh the costs. That means economically,
environmentally and humanely. The risks may be small but when the
perception of the risks are high then dialogue is needed and the First
Nations groups were not getting that information or communication. Who
handles marketing for the nuclear industry?

From the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC) website they say (see
endnote pdf):

____
``…Uranium exploration poses the same low risks to public health or the
environment, as any exploration methods (such as drilling small core
samples). It does not significantly modify the natural environment.
Uranium exploration presents a very low risk of increasing radiation or
radon exposure to the public and to the environment…''
____

____
``…The CNSC ensures streams, lakes and rivers downstream of uranium
mining projects are safe for people, plants, fish and other animals…''
____

____
``…The CNSC assesses monitors and tracks licensees’ environmental
performance to verify that releases to the environment are not harmful
and are below regulatory limits. Since 1994, an ongoing monitoring study
in northern Saskatchewan has assessed the cumulative impacts of radon,
radionuclides and heavy metals on the local environment. Results have
shown that uranium mines have no effect on radon levels, and that
uranium, radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210 levels in fish were often
below detection levels. When measurable, these levels were no different
around mine sites when compared to those at both nearby and remote
reference sites…''

In recent years Quebec, British Columbia and Nova Scotia have placed
moratoriums on uranium mining after investigations into Uranium Mining
practices appeared largely based on pressure from human rights groups.
These groups demand inquiries and reports are made but typically lack
the scientific inquiry and they ignore the properly conducted scientific
studies of already existing reports made by the CNSC.

There has been successful antinuclear activity in affecting change.
Canada and the US both have their share of opposition to all things
nuclear. The majority of cases where restrictions have occurred are due
to emotional reactions based on outdated information and antinuclear
rhetoric that ignores the successes in upgrades and regulations that
apply to all current uranium mining in North America in effect since the
1990s.  

Clearly the discussion with the young activist had a positive effect on
me. I researched the topic. But I scored a few points too. He agreed
that closing down all the coal plants in Ontario was something to be
proud about. The point he did not grasp was that nuclear power was the
main reason that stopping coal was even possible. He also failed to
realize that Ontario would not be able to maintain its low carbon
footprint without nuclear plants. He kept throwing at me the line about
keeping this sustainable. I tried to explain that wind and solar farms
are not sustainable. That was a tough one to crack.

If the wind stops blowing or the sun stops shining in the idealistic
world of renewable energy lovers what energy source comes to the rescue?
Well in Ontario it happens to be natural gas. The same is true for other
parts of the world especially where natural gas is easy to come by.

What is interesting is that nuclear power could do it all alone. But to
humour the pro-renewable camp let’s try to understand why Europe has had
load following reactors and North American reactors don’t. The punitive
attitude towards nuclear would never let modifications take place
without a massive review process. Consequently we don’t even try for new
designs. So, carbon emitting natural gas wins by default because our
system is still out of date and bases their decisions on a dogmatic
approach to radiation dangers that have been proven to be overly
conservative.

In Germany coal is winning that role where they foolishly started
shutting down their nuclear reactors. But the hardest part to grasp is
that if wind and solar were not part of the strategy to start with you
would not need to find energy to replace the frequent losses of wind and
solar power. So the perception that a significant risk exists outweighs
the facts and decisions are made that have serious consequences
economically and environmentally.

I noticed that my adversary and I resorted to our areas of expertise and
I eventually realized our agendas had completely different foci and
prevented us from winning each other over to our own side. It was clear
to me that this individual was more concerned about the rights of
individuals than about the best way to save the ecology of the planet. I
did have a moment where I got him to recognize that nuclear might have a
role in keeping things sustainable. I guess that was an accomplishment.

There was a lesson here. If your adversary calls themselves an activist
you better be prepared to anticipate their bias and try to frame any new
arguments you have from a perspective that they understand. I realized
that my argument should have been that clean water and clean air are
human rights and that nuclear energy happens to be one of the best ways
to accomplish the goals of keeping the air and water clean.
