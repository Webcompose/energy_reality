== Energy Reality Project

I started the Energy Reality Project (ERP) about six years ago when I
realized that more action had to be taken on solving climate change. I
had looked at what the biggest factors were contributing to inaction and
realized that the average person was simply poorly equipped to make
informed decisions or able to have a dialogue. I had also been inspired
by Kirk Sorenson’s videos on Thorium filmed by Gordon McDowell of
Alberta. I was fascinated, as I learned about what was better about
nuclear energy technology, that I was gaining a perspective as to how
energy and the ways it was being used was the biggest contributing
factor to Anthropogenic Global Warming. It was a true epiphany to see
that energy usage was the biggest factor in how our futures unfold.

I was not the only one who realized this. Like everybody who is
interested in science I had considered how the popular notions of
conservation and lifestyle changes might contribute to reducing CO₂
emissions but I realized that the hardship of living without reliable
energy was going to be too great and would be unacceptable to most
people. With such drastic measures such as living without electricity,
the conveniences we all love and take for granted would be one of the
first things to go. We would need to regress. One prevailing thought
shone through the doubt. I could see that it would take an enormous
energy transition. The amount of abundant energy was the key.

The ``reality'' was staring me in the face. We have become gluttons for
coal burning. What was needed was a tranformation. A renaissance. The
unpopular choice would need to become our preferred choice, in fact, our
only choice when it comes to solving the climate crisis.

The Canadian Encyclopedia states about energy:

____
Energy plays a unique and critical role in the world; no activity of any
kind (no ``work'') can take place without the movement or conversion of
energy. Energy use in society is a flow that begins with a source (eg,
coal, uranium, petroleum, the sun) and passes through several
intermediate processes for refinement or conversion to a different form
(eg, electricity, diesel oil, methane), finally reaching a home, vehicle
or industrial plant, where it is introduced into a consuming device (eg,
furnace, motor)."

The Al Gore film ``An Inconvenient Truth,'' a documentary made by the
former Vice President, who has far reaching fame, did a decent job of
explaining the climate change problem. But the organization he formed
after the film’s success, came to be called the ``Climate Reality
Project.'' Their strategy, advocating renewable energy and conservation,
fell far short of true reality and solutions that would make a big
enough difference. He is still training an army of recruits to go out
and spread the word that is only half baked. He calls his trainees
``climate leaders'' which to anyone respectful of nature and aware of
science realizes how arrogant and out of tune that sounds. What can you
say about climate? Yes we affect climate. Now what? The message of Al
Gore is actually harmful. The mission statement on the website2-1 says

____
``…Urgent action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and speed the global
shift to renewables…2-2''
____

Trying to run the world on renewable energy alone, you will discover, is
an exercise in futility. When you look at the popular wind and solar
solutions more closely you will discover they appeal to those who trust
the status quo. The ``feel-good'' aspect of their so-called
``renewable'' ability turns out to be a fantasy. Even the word
``renewable'' goes against the laws of physics. Looking at the origins
of the universe we learn that everything originates from exploding
stars. The sun is one of those stars that still has billions of years
left before its natural cycle ends. Wind and solar are nothing but
diffuse secondary energy that has lost much of its energy entering the
Earth’s atmosphere. Their output reflects their low density which is a
small fraction of the world’s electricity sources and probably always
will be. (See Chapter Eleven on Energy Density)

I realized this when I started comparing wind turbines and solar panels,
in terms of power and how much land and resources were needed, to
nuclear energy.2-3. It was a real eye opener.

It wasn’t until I had started the project that I discovered just how
much Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) had accumulated. The oceans were our natural
buffer without which we would have had warming much sooner. But the
oceans are losing that ability. We have a surplus that won’t stop doing
damage until we return much of the trillion2-4 tons of excess carbon
back to the earth or ocean floor. This gave the project an even stronger
sense of urgency. Stop the warming, sure, but also stop the probable
mass extinctions2-5, as if overfishing weren’t bad enough. We will need
to capture CO₂ from the air to make a significant difference.

It struck me that Gore’s choice of words ``Climate Reality'' were
alarmist. In order to recognize the problems facing our planet we need a
far better set of words that encompasses a solution, something that also
gives us hope. Right now we are given a task to educate ourselves and
others. We need ready and willing individuals that need to know they
have been fed misinformation. Yes training and self-education are
requirements to begin this rescue operation.

=== Becoming an ERP Member

Energy needs to be discussed in a realistic way that takes into account
what science has achieved. If the goal of science is to make a better
future then we need to take the scientists and real experts2-6 seriously
and look at what is economical and what is healthy and achievable for
the planet.

The energy policy set by Obama was pretty much an ``all of the above''
strategy that was more politically motivated than it was economical or
even logical2-7. Now under Trump there is a more hands off approach
leaving market forces to determine the outcome. Trump is a climate
change denier which leaves fossil fuels like coal and natural gas as
acceptable energy policy. There is good reason to collect professional
expert analysis to explore what the reality is when it comes to an
optimum energy balance and we must recognize how that balance might
change. We need to understand how well each technology performs and
their suitability to the geography, how much they need in terms of
resources, their reliability, how the local weather patterns affect them
etc.

The climate scientists and ecologists are calling us into action to
prevent climate change. But equally important and perhaps easier to
tackle are problems such as the threat to species extinction and quality
of life issues. This is another way that attention to your local issues
can help. The same actions that are being called upon to prevent species
extinctions and other things like cleaner air will ultimately assist in
the slowing down of global warming and eliminating the increase in
drastic weather patterns and rising sea levels.

We need to develop ways to provide outreach. I think providing a context
of where nuclear fits in the larger picture is very important. Yes
nuclear scales well, but how well in comparison to renewables? I attempt
to answer some of these questions in this book.

Being ``proactive'' is an important concept. Getting more people out
into the public eye, away from their computers is both healthy and
socially responsible. In our efforts to advocate for better
understanding we need to ask questions. Many of those invited to the
group have shared a lot about energy and we encourage more
participation.

The Energy Reality Project seeks to help everyone better understand
energy and the central role it plays in our lives. The reality is that
in a variety of different forms energy is ultimately the thing that
makes stuff happen. It is the master resource. It allows us to perform
countless useful tasks such as the extraction and processing of raw
materials, production of goods by industry, growing and processing food,
and transporting ourselves from one place to another. It lights our
homes. It allows water to reach our high rise apartments2-8. Saves us
lugging supplies up stairways by powering elevators2-9. It keeps us cool
in the summer and warm in the winter. An abundance of affordable,
reliable energy is a necessary condition for us to live healthy, happy
and prosperous lives. But the unreliable intermittent power sources we
currently call ``renewable'' sources such as wind and solar conflict2-10
with the smooth operation of reliable base load power.

It is because of these fundamental facts that access to energy and its
productive use is what underlies economic systems that, in turn, govern
politics and influence the destiny of nations. It is hard to overstate
the importance of low-cost energy to our lives, indeed to all
civilization. Energy matters. Through a better understanding of these
truths we can make better decisions at all levels that will positively
affect the future of our families, businesses, communities and country.
So, let us roll up our sleeves, delve into the realities of energy!

=== Gaining Perspective

When we look at the most pressing issues of our time it is difficult to
know which ones deserve the most attention. Some problems we can’t
ignore. There are teams of people who get paid to make reports on
weather, power efficiency, demographics about populations affected by
coal etc.

We can try and do the research and bury ourselves in data or we can
attempt to discover what common solution exists for them all. This book
will show how energy is the fundamental factor that ties all these
issues together. See Chapter Eleven and Twelve to see how plentiful,
cheap, clean energy can solve our biggest problems.

The weather is no longer the talk of idle conversation. It has become a
topic of concern because more than ever our lives are affected by the
disasters that are happening all over the planet. Everybody knows that
something is wrong. Even a ten-year-old is aware that the climate is not
as predictable as it used to be. Also most people don’t have any idea we
already have the technology that can save the planet from ruin.

Our goal is to try to educate as many people as possible about the
urgency of making a difference now, before it is too late. Rather than
feeling you are too insignificant to affect change, recognize the
commonality you have with other equally concerned people, knowing that
we can share a technological truth to fix much of what has gone wrong.

You will see in later chapters how the various energy sources fare
handling the big problems such as energy shortages, climate change,
ocean acidification, you name it. We need to consider what must replace
coal plants and natural gas plants. The supplies of natural gas and coal
are one factor. There is a limit. Other factors include a true carbon
footprint that must look at the whole cycle. It will be important to
look at economic analysis. Can we justify overspending for the sake of
security and maintaing military power that affects international
relations. We need to ask whether the cost is too high to push for
inefficient, subsidy dependent intermittent energy like wind and solar
and whether some costs are unnecessary such as very high licensing fees
and the outrageously expensive application process for nuclear plants.
We discuss why energy density makes a difference in Chapter Ten.

The existing coal plants in the US are still far too numerous2-11 to
continue with a ``business as usual'' mentality. Young people and future
generations face a much more degenerate, unsustainable, uninhabitable
world. The recent Clean Power Plan which Donald Trump wants to
dismantle2-12 does not go far enough to reduce and shut down coal
plants. See Chapter Eight and Nine on a National Energy Policy2-13.

=== Information and Misinformation?

Headlines about the planet try to steal our focus while we seek
solutions to our daily immediate problems of income and providing a
support network for our immediate families and communities.

Problems of basic survival will get in the way of dealing with issues
that are greater than each of us. The few moments we do get to ponder
about what matters such as global warming, the melting ice caps, ocean
chemistry and species extinction, they rarely get a few seconds of
notice. If you also happen to be religious you also have your faith
crowding your thoughts for their share of your attention.

=== Are You Part of the Solution?

In the absence of great leadership writers can attempt to enlighten the
reader to sort out and simplify what factors will do the most good
globally. But you might ask why should we choose a global perspective at
all? But we in the west have a loosening of the security we assumed was
part of our existence. The bubble is not so tightly bound anymore. We
are more aware than ever of how much corruption exists and, apart from
security, how many special interest groups are fighting for things many
of us would rather not hear about. That, in addition to a weakening of
our strength as a nation economically, technologically and socially
leaves us in a numb state unable to sympathize with anything outside our
personal lives. The global perspective has been simply that we never
needed to worry about the whole planet until we made it too sick to
sustain us. It really is not so different from cancer. The approach to
cancer and other illnesses has been to treat the symptoms but not
prevent the illness.

=== Should We Feel Guilty?

It depends on how much you connect to the pulse. It’s not all lost if
you occasionally take time out to manage your own life. The sphere of
influence that any individual has over what gets attention in a
democracy is local, at the community level, and that influence can reach
higher levels. But it is the number of like-individuals that actually
make the effort which enables the awareness to spread the actionable
ideas, moving from municipal, to city, to state, to country, to
continent, to various international treaty-bound nations etc.
Buckminster Fuller said ``Think globally. Act locally.''2-15

=== About Becoming a Member of ERP

If you found yourself sympathizing with what I have been saying then
that is all you need in order to qualify to be a member. You are already
welcome. Share, inquire, reach out, be marginalized because chances are
you are already shunned for other reasons. We humans like to pigeon hole
others but in a world gone as bad as ours, I personally feel we all need
to take action. There comes a point where taking a stand is more
important than being accepted by your peers.
