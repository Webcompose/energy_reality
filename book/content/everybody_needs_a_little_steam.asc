== Need a Little STEAM?

Everybody needs a little STEAM. STEAM not STEM. The missing ingredient
is Art, too often overlooked. Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts,
Math (S.T.E.A.M.)

We need to catch up on biology, chemistry and physics that belong to
S.T.E.A.M.6-1 and make the effort to evaluate energy. We need to be
certain about what kind of decisions can make a difference in the
remaining time left to do so.

What about learning complex science? Is Nuclear Physics so hard to
learn? How much do we need? It is complex at the deeper levels but what
you need to know is not so far away or hard to find. Between truth and
fear lies a lot of fact finding to clear up the misconceptions about
nuclear. Once the truth comes out then we can see how the big fossil
fuel energy players care more about profits than about the environment.
Getting a grasp on the science will also help to lighten your view of
what is possible and what is not. Common myths like ``all radiation is
dangerous'' can easily be seen to be false by looking at data that
compares exposure levels and knowing that radiation is everywhere.

The documentary film Pandora’s Promise6-2 uses a powerful analogy right
in the title. What ``promise?'' Robert Stone did a good job of finding a
title that represented a journey of discovery. In a Greek myth, Pandora,
the first woman, is endowed with seductive charms and when given a gift
box labeled ``do not open'', she opens it anyway. Out comes all sorts of
evil. She manages to close the box before the last item escapes. That
last item is ``hope.''

The film shows how five environmentalists with an antinuclear outlook
discover ``hope'' in the form of nuclear energy. All the previous myths
they held started to disappear after inquiring into the real nature of
atomic science. The myths were debunked one by one and the future
outlook appeared less bleak in the face of climate change.

Nuclear power was a path they never considered until they understood the
more immediate danger posed to the planet by climate change and ocean
acidification. The fact that China will have double the carbon emissions
that the US is projected to have in 30 years and also the fact that wind
and solar are totally inadequate to bring poor countries out of poverty
indicates it is imperative, if there is any ``hope'', that it must be
nuclear energy that  will replace coal.

The unwillingness of so many protesters to actually try to understand
the science and relative value both economically and environmentally is
another example of the human failure. Several nuclear reactors in the US
have recently been shut down due to market driven factors. Kewaunee6-3
in Wisconsin6-4 and Vermont Yankee6-5 were forced out of business partly
because of the existence of cheap natural gas. But the other factor is
lack of public awareness. Too many people see the closing of a nuclear
power plant as a victory. I am one that feels both angry and sad that
fear of radiation, and I mean any radiation is very much part of the
North American psyche. There is a huge difference between the reality
and the perception. We need to close this gap.

But the need for the general public to be informed and educated about
nuclear energy has never been acknowledged by those who could make a
difference. The need for public awareness is still not a phenomenon
discussed or explored. Hence the purpose of this book.

Now it makes sense to bring the public, including the gamers, up to
speed on the subject of atomic science and how it led to nuclear energy
because nobody should be left in the dark worried and confused. At this
level governments fail. They don’t properly mandate what is being
taught. This chapter will try to be your orientation. Let the
politicians catch up later.

=== What About the Science?

Let’s start by observing our planet. Have you ever wondered how the
center of the earth stays hot and keeps molten lava flowing? The planet
is billions of years old. Why has it not cooled in that time? It is the
presence of uranium, radium, thorium and potassium changing from one
state to another perpetually releasing energy and heat from radioactive
decay 6-6 that causes the rocks to melt. This was only discovered in the
last 60 years or so.

The age of planet Earth was first calculated in 1956 using nuclear
science by an American geologist Clair Patterson to be 4.5 billion years
old6-7 and it was using a method known as radiometric dating based on
comparing different isotopes of lead. Another trick discovered in the
1940s was carbon dating. It takes the ratio of two different isotopes of
carbon (carbon 12 is constant and carbon 14 decays at 50% every 5,730
years) and is used to accurately measure the age of things up to a
maximum of 50,000 years. These techniques would not be possible without
the advances in nuclear science.

The story of energy can’t be told without understanding the role the
chemists and physicists.  In fact the two types of reactors that
dominates current research and development could be described as
requiring a marriage of the two disciplines.

=== The Early Chemists

When Marie Curie decided to do experiments in the late 1800s with a
strangely behaving unknown substance, it’s high incidence of activity
was brand new territory. Little did she know that she was carrying
around radium6-8 in her pockets. The handling of the materials without
protection would lead to her eventual death 30 years later of aplastic
anemia at age 66. But her accomplishments give women a reason to be
proud. She was the first person and only woman to win the Nobel prize
twice6-9. She  did the world a great service by dedicating her life to
understanding radioactive elements, specifically discovering, naming and
adding radium (origin of the words ``radioactive'' and ``radiation'')
and polonium.   (named after her Polish heritage) to the table of
elements.

Her relatively long life and the long lives of other nuclear scientists
show that radiation is not as bad as people imagine. Marie Curie handled
the substances of varying purity and quantity daily without protection
yet she lived to be a senior. Radium is only found at trace levels
(produced by decaying uranium) because natural radium has largely
vanished due to natural decay. What are called the primordial elements
are still found if their half lives happen to be older than 2 billion
years or so. The longer the half life the lower the radioactivity. The
real damage is done if you eat it or breathe it but otherwise our skin
is a reasonable block to the radiation that is emitted through the air.
The overwhelming majority of nuclear scientists live to an old age
without cancer incidence. No matter where a person lives, it would be
extremely rare to ever encounter high dose radiation. But even if you
work with it or near it daily it is manageable and safe when the right
procedures for handling it are made. You may recall the safety gear that
visitors were asked to wear in news features about Fukushima. The
measures being practiced reflect the attitude of public officials
exercising caution that is an over-reaction in an over-regulated safety
culture. Those safety suits were completely unnecessary.

Historically, the elusive invisible and atomic universe had been viewed
as composed of individual elements that existed alone and unable to bind
and create compounds. Discovering properties of natural elements had
been a French tradition going back to 1789 when Antoine Lavoisier
catalogued 33 of the atomic tables elements6-10. His insights led to the
understanding of compounds that had specific molecular structures.

Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius would further expand that in 1818
calculating the atomic weights of 45 of the known 49 elements including
his personal discovery of Thorium6-11, element 90. Dmitri Mendeleev of
Russia in 1869 had developed what became known as a periodic table of 66
elements6-12 ordered according to their chemical properties. This was
developed without the knowledge of electron shells or orbitals which did
not arrive until 1919.

French chemist Marcellin Berthelot published an important thesis on
compounds in 1860 when most chemists believed compounds from organic
substances could not be recreated in the lab. Berthelot proved them
wrong thus ending the notion of vitalism6-13. He is considered the
greatest chemist ever. He was also able to observe something frightening
about the power of the atom when he said ``Within a hundred years of
physical and chemical science, men will know what the atom is. It is my
belief when science reaches this stage, God will come down to earth with
His big ring of keys and will say to humanity, `Gentlemen, it is closing
time 6-14.'''

=== The Early Physicists

The breakthroughs regarding atomic structure made real progress after
Albert Einstein’s several discoveries and the proposed models of
mathematical modeling based on Brownian motion discovered 28 years
earlier by Robert Brown6-15 who observed the motion of dust grains in
water. Theories formed by John Dalton 100 years earlier6-16 would be
proven true by Jean Baptiste Perrin who used Einstein’s equations to
help prove Dalton was correct. Perrin later was awarded a Nobel
prize6-17 in 1926. Einstein got his Nobel prize in 1921.

Such a web of discoveries and interconnected thoughts led to
advancements that would allow us to send pictures back to the earth from
Pluto in 2015 and Mars for the past several years. The space travel
technology depends on RTG6-18 devices that are a type of nuclear
battery.

=== Einstein’s Famous Equation

Nuclear energy was not new it was just new to humans. Although we
discovered it about 100 years ago nuclear energy was around when the
first stars were born and the big bang occurred. But this knowledge is
relatively new. Einstein lived in a time when nobody understood this
yet. That’s why his insights are all the more incredible.

E = __γ__mc² means ``Energy'' is equal to some specific mass at rest6-19
multiplied times the speed of light squared. The speed of light is so
fast that it is typically a given distance per second. That is 186,000
miles per second. That speed could be expressed as 671,000,000 miles per
hour. The Lorentz factor, gamma, _γ_, says that the faster the objects
are moving with respect to one another, the higher the energy is.

=== Mass vs. Speed of Light

This incredible formula was discovered by Einstein before it was even
possible to prove. It does follow that since c is already a very big
number, based on the speed of light, that being squared makes it an
extra huge amount. Therefore the change in mass must be a small amount
but still very significant. So this formula is an equation that
demonstrates that it is possible to get a huge amount of energy from a
small change in mass. That small change in mass is in fact measurable at
the atomic level.

Somehow Einstein also figured out that nothing could go faster than
light. He calculated that any mass to reach the speed of light would
require a certain number of joules of energy. So when the big
less-stable atoms split and change their atomic weight there is a
measurable amount of energy released. That energy is expressed as E =
__γ__mc². When Einstein produced his equation atoms were not known to be
splitting so his anticipation of what was coming was prophetic, to say
the least.

=== A Little Nuclear Physics

The study of nuclear physics is not everybody’s idea of fun. But some
basics are essential to getting a grasp of why nuclear energy is not
only a dense energy source but it can be and has been made safe to give
nuclear plants the best safety records of all power plants6-20.

One of the polarizing factors in the nuclear industry is the variety of
nuclear plants that have been created and the numerous schools of
thought that accompanies each design. The versatility of the technology
is both a blessing and a curse. But they all have common factors we can
summarize here.

Reactors require what is called a fissile element from the periodic
table. If an element is fissile it is fissionable. Basically, fission is
essential to creating nuclear energy.

Many of the heavier elements in the periodic table no longer exist
naturally but have been recreated in the laboratory. The elements in
existence are the lighter more stable elements. That means most of them
are not decaying. If they are decaying it is at a very slow pace.

The only naturally occurring source of nuclear fuel is Uranium and most
of the uranium we find is in trace amounts that have been transmuted
from plutonium (the uranium we dig up is a low purity daughter element
from decaying plutonium - now essentially gone). Thorium has a unique
advantage as a power source but it is not a fuel, technically, but later
I’ll explain the Thorium Cycle6-21 which produces fissile fuel6-22.
We’ll come back to this.

Uranium is found in trace amounts and needs processing to be as pure as
needed. The ability to create man made isotopes6-23 of radioactive
elements is partly what is keeping the nuclear industry alive. And
although expensive to build, Nuclear Reactors are still the cleanest,
most efficient electricity producers ever by a long shot and the
availability of uranium is not at risk. The economics of nuclear plants
needs demystifying. They don’t need to be expensive. For the most part
they are expensive as a direct result of pressure from lobbyists and
peer groups who fight for greater safety measures for the already very
safe reactors. Any pronuclear advocates worth their salt will tell you
that nuclear reactors are over-engineered and currently lack a
standardized design.

Out of all the different types of reactors available there are three
kinds of reactors we need to consider. For the sake of keeping the
investigation into the science within our grasp let’s simplify our
effort and look at the most popular reactors, the Canadian designs,
American designs and next generation Molten Salt Reactors6-24. The first
two represent the majority of existing reactors that are now in 31
countries: France, Slovakia, Hungary, Ukraine, Belgium, Sweden,
Switzerland, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Finland, Bulgaria, Armenia, South
Korea, Spain, United States, Russia, Romania, United Kingdom, Canada,
Germany, South Africa, Mexico, Pakistan, Argentina, Netherlands, India,
Brazil, China, Iran, Japan and Taiwan and very recently the Arab
Emirates. Egypt is serious about getting them while having a test
reactor for years.

The Canadian Reactors are located in Ontario and New Brunswick.   These
commercial designs are CANDU reactors6-25. They require a much lower
concentration of pure Uranium than American Light Water Reactors
(LWR)6-26. Bruce Nuclear Generating Station, west of Toronto, is the
biggest nuclear power plant (NPP) worldwide employing 3800 workers. It
consists of 8 CANDU reactors all in the 730 MW to 813 MW range totalling
over 6,000 MW. There is a thriving nuclear industry of CANDU reactors
abroad in six countries: Argentina, China, India, Pakistan, Romania and
South Korea.

The biggest difference between the CANDU and varieties of LWR reactors
is the kind of fuel required for their operation. CANDUs do not need to
enrich the fuel to high purity whereas LWRs need slightly higher purity.
CANDUs use pressurized heavy water to control the reactivity rate. LWRs
are a simpler design which are actually a slightly newer innovation that
started around 1950 after Alvin Weinberg’s design6-27 allowing untreated
water as a moderator. The uranium needs to be 3% to 5% pure ²³⁵U for
LWRs6-28 and less than 1% ²³⁵U for CANDUs6-29. By the way, nuclear
weapons require 90% pure ²³⁵U6-30.

When we discuss the actinide elements (numbered 89-103) that are
naturally radioactive we are referring to the heavy elements in the
periodic table where we get the fuel for nuclear power plants. Let’s
look at some of the actinide properties. We discussed Marie Curie’s
experiments with radium and radioactive decay that cause elements to
transmute. Radium-236 is one of several radium (element 88) isotopes. It
decays to radon gas. Thorium (element 90) and Uranium (element 92) are
less radioactive, in fact you can hold thorium and uranium 238 without
any risk of harm6-31. Our bodies can easily handle the low radiation
levels much to the shock of many antinuclear folks.

Transuranic elements are also actinides but heavier than Uranium
(elements 93 and higher) and more unstable than the lighter elements but
they no longer exist naturally. They must be created in the lab. Over
Earth’s history they all decayed or converted to other substances and
gradually vanished. An unstable element is typically ``radioactive.''
The elements that decay faster and have a significant level of decay are
more ``radioactive'' and their decay rate is measured by the amount of
time it takes to decay by half. Thus its called the half life and the
elements with short half-lives are usually the most toxic elements6-32.

=== More on Physics

Uranium was thought to be getting scarce in the early years of the
nuclear industry. That view has changed as the methods for extraction
and reprocessing has been successfully performed. The industry has come
up with some creative ways to collect fissile Uranium including breeder
reactors and the dismantling of nuclear bombs6-33to use the Uranium for
fuel. There are even methods proposed to extract uranium from
seawater6-34. This method has inspired some people to reclassify nuclear
energy as renewable because the oceans have an inexhaustible supply of
dissolved uranium.

We’ve all heard of Plutonium.6-35. The word is very familiar to us. It
is generally man made by using nuclear fission. Because these elements
are unstable they will convert to stable or unstable isotopes meaning
they will have an atomic weight more or less near the natural weight
plus or minus a few neutrons. For instance ²³⁸U is the normal atomic
weight of Uranium but they have some ²³⁵U and 234U mixed with it. Just
trace amounts can weaken Uranium’s fissile ability therefore Uranium is
processed by chemical means either into its useful concentrated ²³⁵U or
into Depleted Uranium (²³⁸U) which is not fissile but used in weapons
ammunition. (note: ²³⁸U can be used as a fertile fuel just like Thorium
in Molten Salt Reactors6-36, 240Plutonium is also fertile but not
fissile.) The important thing is that a fissile element is able to
convert to a new element and in the process releases energy. Note: E =
__γ__mc² explains where the energy comes from in a nuclear reaction.

One of the challenges to learning about the science behind nuclear
energy is the surprisingly unintuitive realities of how fission
works6-37.

All nuclear reactors need fission. Typically they use ²³⁵U (Uranium),
239Plutonium (Pu) or 233U as fuel. They are all radioactive. These
elements are called fissile because they can be used for fission. They
can respond to neutron particles converting to daughter products.
Thorium and ²³⁸U are not fissile but are called fertile since they
respond well to neutron bombardment creating daughter products that are
fissile. Thorium undergoes two transformations. 232Th that undergoes
neutron bombardment, in the presence of fissile elements, converts to
Protactinium and Protactinium decays naturally to 233U. Similarly
fertile ²³⁸U, also in the presence of fissile elements converts to
plutonium-239? The main reason to be excited about these two commonly
found elements and because of the fact that they are both very mildly
radioactive 232Th and ²³⁸U promise to be the fuels of the future. The
Molten Salt Reactor with all of its advantages will perform well with
both and once this proven 1960s technology is scaled up to commercial
nuclear reactor sizes and modernized to withstand high temperatures they
will catch on quickly.

To understand what is meant by energy density and why nuclear power is
so important you need to take a look at the abundant energy acquired
from coal plants. When a Uranium atom splits it releases 100 million
times more energy than a carbon atom that combusts6-38. This explains
why Einstein’s equation is such a big deal and what is meant by density
and why the oil industry feels threatened. It also explains why wind and
solar could never do it alone. It is clear that the support given to
renewable energy by fossil fuel companies is a diversion to make
themselves appear green knowing fully that renewable energy is not a
threat to their dominance of the market share.

Brush up on your STEAM and when you are ready you can start making a
difference.

=== Fission Explained

``A single fission event can yield over 200 million times the energy of
the neutron which triggered it 6-39!''

The word fission is derived from the Latin word findere which means to
split apart. The components of an atom are made up of a nucleus and
electrons. All nuclei (plural for nucleus) consist of protons and
neutrons. The largest atoms, consisting of many protons, neutrons and
electrons, seem to have a limit. Progressing up the periodic table by
atomic weight, they reach a size that makes them less stable and more
vulnerable to collisions with neutrons from other atoms. The best
conditions for a controlled series of collisions have been discovered
from experiments that have been well established for over 40 years.
Pioneers like Enrico Fermi and Glenn Seaborg did much to develop the
techniques needed for controlled fission. The collisions cause a split
in the atom which releases heat. That heat is captured and directed to a
water supply that converts to steam and creates electricity by spinning
a turbine.

The nucleus of an atom is about 10-13 cm. That means if you could line
up 10 trillion nuclei beside each other it would equal one centimeter.
But the electron’s orbits are at quite a distance relatively speaking.
The entire size of an atom would equal approximately 10-8 cm. Fissile
6-40 Uranium has the natural ability to release neutrons which are
needed for fission. Uranium is inserted into a fuel assembly inside the
reactor core. Fission is dependent upon the certain elements being
struck by a neutron that eventually, when struck at the right angle and
velocity, produces, after splitting, new atom isotopes. This splitting
or breaking apart is due to the nuclear fuel, usually Uranium, being
able to absorb the uncharged neutrons. Uranium fuel is set up under
ideal conditions in order to maintain a continuous rate of fission
called a chain reaction. There is a moderator added that stops the chain
reaction from going out of control. The cycle produces more neutrons
which in turn are captured by other uranium atoms. The controls in place
allow fission to produce a steady source of heat that heats up water and
converts it to steam.

Natural uranium comes out of the ground as a mix of 99.3% uranium 238
(²³⁸U) and 0.7 % uranium 235 (²³⁵U) and is mined in places like Cameco
Mines6-41 in Saskatchewan and the actual uranium content in the ore is
between 2% and 20%6-42. For CANDU reactors uranium does not need
enrichment. It does need to go through a milling6-43 process and gets
delivered to a uranium refinery. Processing takes place at one of the
two known facilities in Ontario. These are designated facilities that
convert either to uranium dioxide6-44, for the CANDU, or uranium
hydroxide (Uranyl Hydroxide)6-45 for LWR fuel.

What happens when observing the binding forces in order of the smallest
atomic weights to the largest? There is an inverse relationship to an
atoms stability to its size. The atoms actually reverse their ability to
bind and these atoms are described as too large to remain stable. The
ideal binding elements are, no surprise, iron and nickel. But really the
study of the elements properties are the key. The elements instability
are caused by their size. It’s actually the opposite relationship in
gravitational forces of large bodies where we observe the larger the
object the greater the attractions. Gravity is ignored at the atomic
level. The size of the particles are immune individually. Collectively
of course they are indeed influenced by gravity.

Warning! You can skip this section if you are not interested in the
details.

Isotopes6-46 are regular atoms plus or minus a neutron or two and for
the most part retains the original properties.  Depending on the balance
of neutrons, protons and electrons an isotope can be radioactive or
non-radioactive. Isotopes of Uranium and, much less commonly, Plutonium
are the most used in Nuclear Power plants. The atomic number like the
233 in 233U indicates the number of protons in an element. Every proton
in an atom is matched by at least as many neutrons. The order starts at
a lower atomic weight - elements 89-103 plus the heavier elements
104-118. The transuranics 93-118 are unique because of the fact that
they no longer occur naturally on Earth.

Neutrons are uncharged and very useful. Here’s where the clever idea
came from to manipulate6-47 the isotopes. Being uncharged they have the
ability to penetrate an atom more deeply. The neutrons released by the
radioactive elements ²³⁵U or P239U are typically too fast to be absorbed
efficiently by ²³⁵U (²³⁵U is uniquely configured to absorb slow
neutrons) but if moderators such as water, heavy water or graphite are
added then a chain reaction can be sustained6-48.

Theoretically, when we fission a heavy nucleus, we are really just
taking energy that was stored as mass in a proverbial tiny ball under
immense gravity and pressure before the Big Bang. When it exploded
billions6-49 of years ago all kinds of elements were created. Stars
eventually formed, aged and subsequently exploded again in super novas.
These kinds of activities produced many of the heavy elements that still
exist. Many of them transmuted to other elements and those with shorter
half lives disappeared. Since the short range nuclear force can only
hold such a big atom together for so long, all we ever find naturally
that can be fissioned and that has not already decayed is Uranium.

Nobody really knows what causes that short range nuclear force but if
the big bang really did happen then that bang of the universe changing
from a condensed tiny area then massively exploding would retain some of
its original properties. Hence the strong binding force by definition is
likely related to that unique primordial moment of unmatched extreme
density. 

=== The Thorium Cycle.

When discussing alternative reactor designs it is the Molten Salt
Reactor (MSR) that has been making a return from obscurity. Now it’s
gained a cult status around the world. One of the MSR designs provides a
means to breed fissile fuel from fertile elements such as ²³⁸U and
232Th. The thorium cycle takes advantage of Glenn Seaborg’s discovery
that Thorium can produce the isotope 233U. Seaborg with the help of his
lab assistant observed that Thorium, when in the presence of ²³⁵U or
233U, converts to 233Protactinium and then decays after 27 days to
become Uranium 233 which is not found naturally in significant
concentrations.

Thorium has 90 protons and is element 90. In it’s natural state it has
an equal number of protons and electrons. Since Thorium is not fissile
it must offer other benefits to gain this cult status. Through neutron
capture in the presence of other fissile material it will convert to
Protactinium. Protactinium consequently naturally decays to Uranium-233
which is certainly capable of fissioning .

Thorium fuel has favorable properties that improve performance in a MSR.
Compared to the uranium dioxide(), thorium dioxide (ThO2) has a higher
melting point, higher thermal conductivity, and lower coefficient of
thermal expansion. ThO2 also exhibits greater chemical stability and,
unlike UO2, does not further oxidize. Aqueous Molten salts melt at a
higher temperature at normal atmospheric pressure unlike the high
pressures that Light Water Reactors and CANDU reactors need just to keep
the cooling water in a liquid state that would otherwise become steam.

Fluoride salt has some very stable qualities. Fluoride is the salt of
choice for Thorium LFTR’s. For those interested in chemistry Fluoride is
chemically stable but Fluorine is not.

One benefit from using the Thorium cycle is that there is an inevitable
quantity of ²³²U that gets produced during fission. This quantity is
sufficient to make it impractical to create weapons grade fuel. It
essentially poisons the 233U nuclear fuel therefore it is inherently
proliferation resistant. ²³²U cannot be chemically separated from 233U
and has several decay products that emit high-energy gamma radiation
making it easy to detect.

These high-energy photons are a radiological hazard that necessitate the
use of remote handling of separated uranium and aid in the passive
detection of such materials. 233U can be denatured by mixing it with
natural or depleted uranium, requiring isotope separation before it
could be used in nuclear weapons.
