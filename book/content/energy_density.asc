== Energy Density

The energy stored in atoms has been hypothesized as beginning before the
big bang that has continuously expanded ever since. The theory states
that before the big bang all matter was compressed into a tiny sphere
and that the pressure exerted on each atom, created properties that
remained thereafter. Hence the mysterious force that keeps atoms glued
together although still unproven have become useful to us billions of
years later.

If there could ever be a lesson learned that can make a person recognize
why we need nuclear power, it is the case for energy density. All of the
energy choices have a small power output compared to nuclear. We are
going to look at how various energy forms differ by the quantity of fuel
per unit and in the case of wind, solar and hydro their energy footprint
that needs to factor in efficiencies and dependencies.

Energy Density measures how much heat is released in any given second of
time. A joule is the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current
of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second.

MegaJoules per Kilogram MJ/Kg Sugar is 19 MJ/Kg Coal is 24 MJ/Kg Fat is
39 MJ/Kg Gasoline is 46 MJ/Kg Uranium is 76,000,000 MJ/Kg See11-1

There are two ways to look at energy density. One is by looking at how
much energy is produced per unit of fuel. Nuclear fuel is as compact as
you can get. The power contained in several pellets of Uranium is
literally very dense. Two is by looking at how much energy is produced
by the resource equivalent whether that be wind, sunlight or water. The
energy produced per unit of fuel is easy to calculate. The energy
produced by wind, sunlight and hydro are trickier values to calculate.
Wind and solar are more of a problem to sort out because they are
dependent on things that are less predictable like the weather or
daylight. Their dependencies are also hard to ignore. Both wind and
solar energy depend on other energy types whenever the wind stops
blowing or the sun stops shining.

(Wind Turbine Density: 0.03 MJ/Kg)(Solar Panel Density: 0.0000015
MJ/Kg)But which type of energy source will replace the missing wind and
solar energy?

In the U.S. its natural gas. Other places that find natural gas too
expensive are more likely to use dirtier sources of energy like coal. If
the local land formations allow it pumped storage power plants can be
used but they are not available everywhere.

The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) helps compare their value.

``The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) is a measure of a power
source which attempts to compare different methods of electricity
generation on a comparable basis. It is an economic assessment of the
average total cost to build and operate a power-generating asset over
its lifetime divided by the total energy output of the asset over that
lifetime. The LCOE can also be regarded as the minimum cost at which
electricity must be sold in order to break-even over the lifetime of the
project.''

Wikipedia: Cost of Electricity by source

``Roadmap to Nowhere'' is a chapter from a book called ``Power to the
Planet'' by Mike Conley and Timothy Maloney that helps illustrate what
the problem is with so-called renewable energy.

Four bottom lines up front:

It would cost over $29 Trillion to generate America’s baseload electric
power with a 50 / 50 mix of wind and solar farms, on parcels of land
totalling the area of Indiana. Or:

It would cost over $18 Trillion with Concentrated Solar Power (CSP)
farms in the southwest deserts, on parcels of land totalling the area of
West Virginia. Or:

We could do it for less than $3 Trillion with AP-1000 Light Water
Reactors, on parcels totalling a few square miles. Or:

We could do it for $1 Trillion with liquid-fueled Molten Salt Reactors,
on the same amount of land, but with no water cooling, no risk of
meltdowns, and the ability to use our stockpiles of nuclear ``waste'' as
a secondary fuel.

One estimate by my colleague Mathijs Beckers is that if the U.S. were to
go 100% renewable the rest of the world would have no resources left to
do the same. That’s how much we would need in materials such as steel,
concrete, aluminum and copper wire. China and India would be stuck
burning fossil fuels.

Despite Germany’s plans to shut down nuclear power plants they will have
trouble shutting them down. They boast about their plans to make
renewable energy the dominant energy source regardless of the fact that
they have achieved only a 15% share in the energy mix. Misguided
intentions considered, they are not tsunami prone like Fukushima was in
Japan. Energiewende cannot shut down nuclear power easily because
currently they provide so much of the missing energy. Unlike the U.S.
natural gas is more expensive in Europe because they don’t have the
geological conditions for natural gas. What they do have ironically is
coal which has been added to their energy mix. The dirtiest kind of coal
fleet called lignite is now expanding in Germany. In fact it makes up
over 50% of their electricity in the country cited as being largely
renewable.

Energy density of nuclear energy is precisely why it is by far the most
significant factor in reducing Carbon emissions. We all know that
nuclear power is mighty. We think of phrases like ``harness the atom''
and ``split the atom.'' What is hard to grasp about nuclear energy is
just how much energy is contained in uranium, plutonium or thorium. It
is because of this huge amount of energy created per unit of fuel that
makes it so appealing and after comparing you will see that it is
necessary.

Being energy literate you will begin to see why nuclear energy is so
desperately needed. Being painfully aware of the threat carbon dioxide
has become and being energy literate we realize its the facts that
matter.

We know coal is by far much more harmful and deadly than nuclear. The
nuclear safety record is the best. To illustrate the point let’s try to
imagine an impossible scenario that for all the planet’s nuclear plants
we managed to produce one chernobyl accident a day. First remember that
depending where you heard about Chernobyl the numbers will vary. But we
would still be doing better than the current damages being done by coal
pollution. Coal kills 1 million people a year worldwide. That’s 2700 a
day worldwide. Looking at just the U.S. that’s  24,000 a year or 67 a
day. Considering Chernobyl’s official death toll is 60 people it is fair
to say that nuclear energy in a worse case scenario is still a better
choice than coal.  Also consider that nuclear accidents are very rare.
Count the coal mine accidents, the natural gas explosions, the oil
spills, the hydro dams bursting, even the repairing of wind turbines and
installation of solar panels has had more accidents than nuclear plants.
But everyone remembers the three nuclear plant accidents over the entire
history of commercial nuclear plants that killed less than 100 people
combined and that was all in Chernobyl. 

The countries of China and India dwarf our North American countries.
They are desperate to come out of poverty. Will they listen to the brats
marching for green power. Those who march in the name of renewable
energy and conservation have never lived without energy for any length
of time that matters.

Why can’t weather dependent wind and solar solve our problems?

Wind and solar power are diffuse and unpredictable. We know when the sun
shines if there’s no cloud cover. And there are regions that have more
wind and there are regions that have more sun but they are not the norm.
Last century the countries that had power mostly ran on reliable power.
Our grid is geared to handle reliable power. We call reliable power base
load power like nuclear, hydro, natural gas, oil and of course coal.
Over 400 coal plants exist in the U.S. and we keep saying we need to
stop coal plants. 60% of American electricity comes from coal.

Does running a lemonade stand in front of your house as a child prepare
you for the retail business? Hardly.  

A uranium pellet the size of your finger tip produces (with zero
emissions) the same energy as 1,780 pounds of coal.

Here is a quote from Alex Cannara who keeps his group members primed for
encounters and this is a simple to understand explanation:

“Ok gang, here’s the pinky story: Hold up a pinky.  If the top two
joints of your pinky were Uranium 235, it would run your profligate
American life for 10 years.  That would give you two pinkies of `waste'
including a teeny amount of the long lasting kind like Plutonium.

That ``waste'' is usable in advanced reactors and they decay to ordinary
elements taking anywhere from seconds to a few centuries.  So every
decade, that individual would have to find a pill bottle to put the
waste in and bury it next to the prior decade’s bottle in their back
yard.  Each bottle could indicate when it can come back out.

Wade Allison & some other sensible Brits in an attempt to show their
confidence of the safety of such stored waste offered their gardens as a
place for the ``waste.''

One pinky’s worth of pure fissile Uranium produces enough energy to
supply a single person for 10 years leaving behind two pinky sized
pellets of so-called ``waste'' fission products (much of it is
reusable). Producing the same amount of energy from coal would take 286
refrigerator loads to produce 20 refrigerator loads of coal ash. "

From Booklet on IAEA website Energy density comparisons (fuel and land
requirements)

The quantity of fuel used to produce a given amount of energy - the
energy density - determines in a large measure the magnitude of
environmental impacts as it influences the fuel extraction activities,
transport requirements, and the quantities of environmental releases and
waste. The extraordinary high energy density of nuclear fuel relative to
fossil fuels is an advantageous physical characteristic.

One kilogram (kg) of firewood can generate 1 kilowatt-hour (kW•h) of
electricity. The values for the other solid fossil fuels and for nuclear
power are:

One kilogram of:

kilowatt hours (kWh)

firewood

1

coal

3

oil

4

uranium

50,000(3,500,000 kW•h with reprocessing)

Consequently, a 1,000 MW(e) plant requires the following number of
tonnes (t) of fuel annually:

Plant Fuel

No. of Tonnes (t) per year

How much spaceit occupies

coal

2,600,000 t

2,000 train cars(1,300 t each)

oil

2,000,000 t

10 supertankers

uranium

30 t

reactor core(10 cubic metres)

The energy density of fossil and of nuclear fuel allows relatively small
power plant areas of some several square kilometers (km²). The low
energy density of renewables, measured by land requirements per unit of
energy produced, is demonstrated by the large land areas required for a
1000 MW(e) system with values determined by local requirements and
climate conditions (solar and wind availability factors ranging from 20
to 40%):

Type of Power Plant

Area (km2)

Fossil and nuclear sites

1–4 km2

Solar thermal or photovoltaic(PV) parks

20–50 km2(a small city)

Wind fields

50–150 km2

Biomass plantations

4000–6000 km2

Comparing the energy output difference of Uranium to Coal

Comparing the energy output difference of Thorium in Molten Salt
Reactors to Uranium to coal

Who’s the Fairest of them All

There was a time when Nuclear Energy was the cheapest going by the
accounting. In fact it still is over long periods of time.

Looking at figures from 1982 page 98 The Environmental Case for Nuclear
Power

Kirk Sorensen explains how energy dense a Thorium Molten Salt Reactor
based on his LFTR design would be.

``A mere 6,600 tonnes of thorium could provide the energy equivalent of
the combined global consumption of 5 billion tonnes of coal, 31 billion
barrels of oil, 3 trillion cubic meters of natural gas, and 65,000
tonnes of Uranium''

Hydro uses kinetic energy from the flow of water. Wind uses kinetic
energy from the flow of air. Solar uses electromagnetic radiation from
the fusion reactions on the sun. 

The different fuels we use as energy sources are either combustible or
fissionable. The combustible type is the breaking of chemical bonds
called an exoergic or exothermic reaction. 95 percent of the world’s
energy is created from combustion of coal, oil and natural gas.

That leaves us with nuclear energy which relies on another type of
energy release from breaking a nuclear binding force. The reaction
depends on using uranium or plutonium. Thorium is still experimental but
could prove to be an indirect fuel that goes through the thorium cylcle
to produce uranium.  Thorium has advantages based on its abundance 4
times more plentiful than Uranium, better fission products than Uranium.
As Kirk Sorensen explains the real advantages of Thorium are a real game
changer when the reactor is using the molten salt reactor as it’s
design. It is the fluid that makes all the difference. Hot fluid mixture
allows nearly full utilization of the fuel.
