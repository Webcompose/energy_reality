== Exploring a National Energy Plan

``Oh, What a tangled web we weave.'' Walter Scott

The Clean Power Plan8-1 set out by Obama has undergone a reversal in
many ways. Trump’s policy is Libertarian in the sense that he follows
their mantra ``less government.'' The idea of ``energy dominance'' and
reduced restrictions on coal and other fossil fuels indicates how he
views energy as an economic opportunity. Exporting coal and liquified
natural gas are just two examples of how the strategy is unfolding. But
support for nuclear energy seems even more pronounced than the lip
service Obama’s energy plan preached. Trump’s policy is looking like a
shift away from an ``all-of-the-above'' approach and away from renewable
energy. The support for wind and solar under Obama had much more
subsidized support.

It was starting to look like the kind of plan we saw happen in Germany
that has gone backwards in their attempts to reduce emissions. But if
Trump has his way the US will start to resemble China with a focus on
economic growth at the expense of the environment. Where German and US
policy Obama-style were a kind of deal that could only be made by naive
environmentalists, with a little help from deceptive business
executives, Trump’s plan is an openly crass approach to the point of
gross negligence. But where Obama’s plan had very little to encourage
nuclear energy there is evidence that nuclear energy is beginning to be
taken seriously. The importance of energy begins to reveal itself in
relation to the economy, the environment and in politics when Trump
states that he wants to ``make America great again'' or that he wants
the U.S. to dominate in energy and when he chooses to spend so much on
the military. It becomes clear that energy plays a vital role in
prosperity, independence, the environment and geopolitical
battlegrounds.

There have been a number of rebuttals8-2 as far back as 2010 from top
scientists and analysts debunking the claims that we could move to 100
percent renewable energy. In addition nuclear plant closures have been
reversed in New York and Illinois with the help of pronuclear
environmental activists like Environmental Progress led by Michael
Shellenberger and Generation Atomic led by Eric Meyer. A recent
announcement by the Department of Energy under Secretary Rick Perry
stated that the US needs to make Nuclear Energy ``cool again'' and that
clean energy goals must include nuclear energy.

Developing a national energy policy for a country like the United States
does have significant challenges. Obama’s Clean Energy Plan has been
viewed by most as ``comprehensive'' but from a checks and balances
perspective it has placed far too much emphasis on renewable energy and
conservation. Whereas ``renewable'' wheels have been in motion for a few
years, that trend is changing and coal plant closures are expected to
slow down under Trump.

While some state moratoriums block new nuclear plants and Renewable
Portfolio Standards require a minimum percentage of renewable energy,
the current policies are making the outlook for nuclear energy less dim.
The insanely lopsided American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 is
a stimulus package, again, mostly ignoring nuclear energy.

``A massive $800 billion economic stimulus package aimed at job creation
and the promotion of investment and consumer spending Included $4.3
billion in tax credits to homeowners for energy efficiency improvements
in 2009-2010, $300 million for reducing diesel engine emissions, $21.5
billion for energy infrastructure, $27.2 billion for energy efficiency
and renewable energy research and investment, $2 billion in research for
DOE, $600 million in research for NOAA.''8-4

This development was meant to be a stimulus package to assist in
economic recovery from the crash of 2008. It defines several initiatives
in a lot of detail but misses the point. Nuclear energy is not even
mentioned. This one fact alone is the kind of fact that justifies the
whole purpose for writing this book.

Our biggest challenge is that nuclear power is viewed negatively mostly
from sensationalized media and outright propaganda. But, in reality it
is an econòmy driver and environment saver. Nuclear plants provide more
jobs than any other type of power plant and there are quite a number of
related industry jobs too.

``The Brattle Group has determined that nuclear plants operating in
Pennsylvania contribute approximately $2.36 billion to state gross
domestic product (GDP) ($3.56 billion in gross output), account for
15,600 in-state full time jobs (direct and secondary), help keep
electricity prices low, and are responsible for $81 million in net state
tax revenues annually.''

The public needs to grow up about their fears; and not just about
nuclear energy. The nuclear industry has been punished long enough. The
blatant truth is that few people really get it.  The biggest
misconception is about the scope. Its about what we call energy density
and energy capacity. Wind, solar, tidal, geothermal and biofuel are
simply not able to contribute enough to make a big enough difference.
They are comparatively wasteful economically and draw unsustainably on
available resources of land and materials in order to meet the required
demand. Investors need to understand this when making decisions to
finance such energy sources. Investing in a company that is developing a
new type of nuclear reactor is possibly the most important investment
anybody could make not only financially but morally.

Tidal has it’s predictability factor advantage so using tidal may
eventually work better than wind and solar however to be effective
requires a large coastal region at billions of dollars in construction
costs.

What Factors Need to Be Considered Before Making a Policy?

[arabic]
. The survival issue reminding people of the urgency before the
irreversible happens triggering mass extinction.
. The capacity issue of increasing nuclear power usage and it having a
power density several orders of magnitude greater than any other
available source.
. the issue of good-for-the-environment, emissions-free nuclear plants
(80% of America’s clean energy) being built despite people’s perceptions
and fears
. the issue of weaning people off of an unhealthy Amerocentric view that
ignores the emerging economies like China and India who are not going to
slow down just to meet carbon emissions limits.
. the cost issue that prevents further nuclear expansion. Costs can be
lowered if people’s perception viewed nuclear energy with a more
rational point of view. They are a privilege not a burden.

Nuclear power is our best hope. The majority of people around the world
fail to recognize the urgency of our current need to stop CO₂ emissions
and the U.S. government and all policy makers need to take a global
perspective on CO₂ emissions. While the U.S. is committed to gradually
reducing coal (far too gradual) the growing economies in China and India
have a rapid expansion of coal burning power plants taking place.

Clearing up the misconceptions and myths will help with making a set of
guidelines for a diverse set of regions and jurisdictions. It is a
challenge. Not every guideline will be a perfect fit. Energy policy in
our case needs to make the case that nuclear energy has the most
potential to do the most benefit. Windy regions should explore wind
power and sunny regions should explore solar but all locations will
benefit from nuclear power.

Keep in mind that current models of reactors are still feasible but that
new sizes need to be considered to more effectively deal with making
transitions more affordable and adaptable to less populated regions. The
model we aim for would ideally be well-suited for anywhere in the world.
The Small Modular Reactor (SMR) will play a role and it should be any
leader’s priority to clear a path for the over regulated nuclear
industry.

Currently there are 11 states that have a moratorium to stop new builds
of nuclear power plants. As of 2010, 104 reactors at 65 nuclear power
plants delivered 20 percent of the nation’s electricity. Since then
three plants have been closed before the end of their useful lifetime
partly due to public pressure over minor issues and the fact that
under-regulated natural gas is cheaper to buy. Thankfully there are a
few new reactors nearing completion.

The biggest reality check about wind and solar energy is that they
cannot compete with what is called base load power. There is very little
similarity between the commonly held ``champions'' of the green movement
and base load power. Comparing the availability and reliability is the
first dramatic difference.

Several nuclear plants have recorded performance times as lasting well
over a year without a shutdown. Base load is also the fundamental type
of energy that we have been running for over a century that has rarely
disappointed us for extended periods of time. Much more reliable base
load such as nuclear energy has not given us much grief for its steady
performance over the long term. We have a fairly dependable grid
infrastructure. Some aspects need upgrades and more challenges have been
added such as severe weather.

The electricity system in the U.S. is a huge web of interconnected power
cables mostly above ground. The combined regional grids make up the wide
area synchronous grid. But ``grid'' can mean local or a widespread area.
Even microgrids exist to support small communities. Four major regional
grids exist across Canada and the United States. They are the Western
Interconnection8-7, Eastern Interconnection8-8, Quebec
Interconnection8-9 and  Electric Reliability Council of Texas
(ERCOT)8-10. Some people refer to them generally as ``the grid.''

Each regional grid consists of an Independent System Operator (ISO) (In
Ontario - Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO)) that run
within each state or province and the larger organizations that
encompass several states called a Regional Transmission Organization
(RTO). Ontario has Hydro One Incorporated an electricity transmission
and distribution utility. The remaining provinces have their own.

Transmission lines can have shared ownership that includes
investor-owned utilities, rural cooperatives and government agencies.

The control of a national grid is dependent on what are a mix of utility
companies including rural utility cooperatives as well as public utility
companies. They all have regulators. The NERC is the widest regulator
covering The US, Canada and Mexico. FERC is the US regulator that
governs the US power providers. To deal with the reliability and
availability of power a number of ``power pools'' have been formed that
merge their resources to improve reliable distribution.

To get a better idea of performance factors let’s look at the three
classifications of power transmission defined by function.

1)      Base load power is provided by coal, hydro and nuclear power.

2)      Intermittent power is provided by wind, solar, wave and tidal
power.

3)      Peaking Power is provided by natural gas. Also called load
following reactors natural gas plants have flexibility to ramp up and
down more quickly than nuclear or coal plants.

Most nuclear reactors in the U.S. do not load follow however Chicago’s
Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) models do. France and Germany have LWRs that
operate in constant load follow mode designed for that purpose. The
CANDU reactors have some that can handle load following in urgent
situations but they simply redirect the steam to the sky which is not an
efficient way to handle it. They will need to be upgraded for better
load following where power fluctuation is designed into the reactor. If
Ontario continues to add intermittent wind and solar then this kind of
engineering into a CANDU is not so difficult. It would involve a
redesign of the control rod system. However new reactor designs will
inevitably have load follow capability given that renewables are now
contributing more of the energy mix.

Some of the other power sources not mentioned such as geothermal,
biofuel, wood and liquid natural gas could theoretically provide base
load power if their availability were in large enough quantities,
reliable and affordable but so far they have none of these attributes.

Consideration for reliable power needs to be part of the decision
process. Choosing to eliminate base load power sources to make room for
subsidized renewable is a mistake. The only way governments can deal
with removal of base load is to import base load from remote sources
like neighboring regions or to extend the reach of dispatchable power.
This requires more transmission lines and is prohibitively expensive.

Why We Pay Twice as Much For Wind and Solar

The subsidies needed for the otherwise unprofitable wind and solar
business cause electric bills to climb out of control and to make
matters worse the system becomes  unreliable. When the wind does not
blow and the sun does not shine natural gas plants kick in and attempt
to do their job load following.  The U.S. is happy about energy
independence from Middle Eastern Oil but have been closing a blind eye
to the fact that leakage of methane is being reported wherever fracking
occurs. Varying levels have been recorded as low as 1.5% and as high as
2.5% which makes natural gas just as bad as coal regarding CO₂.

As a result of the subsidies granted for wind and solar the consumer
ends up paying twice: once for the subsidy that guarantees the wind or
solar company payment as if they were run twenty-four-seven. And second
when natural gas load follows. In fact wind and solar  run only 20% to
30% of the time and natural gas must be running full time even when they
are not needed. The need for load following is the handicap of
``renewable'' wind and solar. I am not opposed to wind and solar but
spending becomes wasteful when redundant power is created simply to
accommodate the overrated power sources of wind and solar.

In addition to a poor distribution network of natural gas pipelines the
cold weather states have more complications when pipes freeze.

This forces businesses that need reliable steady power to relocate. 
Governments keep consulting the wrong people. If they attempt to
eliminate nuclear power it will be the slow path to disillusionment when
the hopes and dreams of replacing coal and nuclear will be impossible
without ruining the economy. The idealists that make up the supporting
fans of renewable energy could save themselves time by learning about
energy density.

We have the failed experiment of Germany as a perfect example. When
their government chose to close down their most reliable non-polluting
power sources (nuclear power) they discovered that renewable power was
disruptive. Many companies were forced to leave the country. Public
utilities were unable to make a profit and nuclear power was imported
from France. Ironically the riddled-with-green policy of Germany’s
Energiewende discovered the hard way that it was necessary build coal
plants to replace that precious base load nuclear power.

When Japan shut down its 52 nuclear reactors they were forced to import
large quantities of liquified natural gas to replace the lost power.

How dense energy fits into the discussion has already been touched upon.
One uranium pellet is the equivalent of 3 barrels of oil,   1 ton of
coal, 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas.

Land Footprint by Type of Energy

1000 MWe (typical size) nuclear power plant is 0.8 square km

1000 MWe Wind Farm  uses 572 square km

1000 MWe Biomass Farm uses 4002 square km

1000 MWe Solar farm uses 177 square km

Our energy policy includes educating people to draw their own
conclusions based on comparing the options which I hope this book and,
eventually, our website will provide.

But we need to make it clear why nuclear energy and nuclear science is
so important to everyone. It’s true that we need more scientists and
engineers to fill the jobs but we also need the general public to
embrace nuclear so the jobs can be created and the remediation applied.

Part of the problem is that most people feel that it is too complicated
to understand nuclear. We can change that perception. It is not so
esoteric. It can be made into a more easy to digest subject by starting
with the numerous non-energy benefits of nuclear. For this point to be
understood simply look at the wide range of benefits nuclear science has
given us beyond energy and weapons. See YouTube video The Future of
Nuclear Technology … After Fukushima with Alan E. Waltar8-6

Times have changed. We used to be able to ignore what science and
industry were doing. We could get on with our lives in particular areas
of self indulgence. It was a lesson of democracy, freedom of choice and
laissez-faire. But what has changed is that now the balance has been
tipped. The paradise is sick. The responsibility to correct the problem
needs to be shared by all of us, from our grandparents to our grand
children.

The chances of a nuclear accident in North America any time soon are
very, very remote. Yet after the Fukushima accident of 2011 the agencies
assigned to the job of making sure we stay as safe as possible are at it
again.

In Canada where restrictions are not as rigid the introduction of a
mandatory supply of iodine pills has been suggested for the areas near
the nuclear plants in Ontario. This ruling should not be a deterrent and
cause for fear. But it is. (See: Toronto Star: Article) It is important
to be prepared but the thinking behind such decisions need to be
understood in the larger context. We know how this vital technology can
help a society progress. We need to advocate that we should learn to
accept the hidden world of nuclear, make it a part of education and
general knowledge and being prepared for a very low probability of an
accident is responsible and not cause for alarm.

There is going to be that time when observing such rules as making a
full stop at a stop sign will seem relatively insignificant when chaos
surrounds us and scenes of local street signs being washed away by
floods and storms will not surprise us. Let’s hope not.

Acceptance of nuclear would also allow its cost to come down.
Politicians listen to the voters. When politicians realize there is more
acceptance and support they can push for reforms. Replacing coal won’t
happen until it becomes acceptable to use nuclear and when the costs
come down again. We must question the framework of a democracy when
smart decisions are so needed and profit motive becomes the deterrent
from success but if we can persuade public opinion through education and
promotion then we must. Only then, can we begin to reverse the momentum
of increased CO₂ and consequently global warming and growing ocean
acidity which will kill the oceans and bring about many calamities.

The biggest obstacles to nuclear energy acceptance are irrational fear
and the energy competitors know this and play it up. Our focus in
delivering an energy policy is to make sure the majority of the people
understand why nuclear is the best energy choice. Although explaining
and comparing the various energy sources is beneficial it is not so
beneficial to stress one kind of reactor over another. All nuclear
reactors are better in the sense that a car is better than a bicycle.
Striving to reduce CO₂ should be a priority commitment for us all.

The product we already believe in, is great in all current commercial
reactor configurations. What’s left to explain are the limits, the
margins, the deceptions, the misconceptions, the probabilities and
therefore whether current policies are problematic and need changing. In
North America we would not welcome a leader who believed the Earth was
flat. Why should we welcome leaders who view nuclear energy as too
dangerous. We could also impose limits on car emissions that would
entirely eliminate combustion engines but we don’t for practical
reasons. The same should be true for nuclear energy. Practical reasons
suggests we should not impose such extreme safeguards on nuclear plants
the one power source we know is emission-free.

Nuclear Power Plants

We want to keep all, or most, of the current operating reactors running
as long as their useful lives last. It is wise to keep these power
horses going. Nuclear energy is dense, carbon free, and affordable with
many economic and environmental advantages. Upgrades to reactors every
20 years or so essentially make the old reactors into new reactors.

There are huge savings made keeping the original infrastructure in
place. We know new nuclear plants are currently very expensive but if
upgrades can be made at a fraction of the price of building a new one
then it should be done. That’s why it has it is tragic when a useful
power plant is forced to shut down for economic reasons because the
``free'' market allows competition from unregulated natural gas.

We have witnessed one plant in particular who could not compete with
natural gas. That is the Kewaunee Nuclear Power

The Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) technology is available now but some legal
regulatory obstacles still remain. There is no doubt, the NRC and the
EPA has been antagonistic toward the nuclear industry and have made
reversing rules and regulations a long drawn out process called
ratcheting. But an informed public is what is needed to begin to reverse
the process. In this case rather than ``trickle down'' economically it
would be a ``trickle up'' effect intellectually that would motivate the
leadership to make sweeping decisions that would bring about the reform
and new policy-making that is so desperately needed.

For example the coal plants which have given China it’s much needed
power at a rate of one coal plant a week are being delayed in India for
political and corrupt business reasons. The way I would play that
``civilization game'' would be to add nuclear R & D to the local
schools, promote nuclear energy with a focus on Molten Salt Reactors. I
know India is creating ads that promote nuclear energy. Good first
steps.

The newest US reactors, the AP-1000, most limiting factor to growth is
the expense but still we need to encourage awareness of the long term
benefits and the eventual return on investment. This is a good example
of economies of scale. There is no other energy source other than hydro
that gives back so much and for so long. Reactors that cost up to 20
Billion dollars or more are still a safe long term investment.

We also support North American initiatives such as Molten Salt Reactors
and Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) with commercial roll-outs in 7-10
years.

SMRs we encourage especially the designs that are passively safe and
will help allay the common fears about reactors. Non-pressurized
reactors in particular are the safest for future reactors. All current
reactors have aspects that, although engineered very well, still scare
people. Pressurized water explosions (or even nuclear detonations – tell
them not possible) and the potential for subsequent widespread
contamination are likely the biggest fears.

So-called ``Renewables''

The word ``renewable'' is an over-used and inappropriate term that has
won the hearts of too many. What good is renewable energy if they are
only available twenty percent of the time as is the case for wind. ( see
article: Wind Farms Generate Below 20 Percent of Their Supposed
Output…2014 Nuclear Issues Vol 37 No 7 September ) It is not yet a
feasible technology. Wind, waves and solar may have their place but not
as a grid source for dependable electricity. The wind and solar farms
are not ready for prime time. In fact they are harmful to industry and
existing full time energy sources. It’s called resonance or
sub-synchronous power that because of their intermittent, unreliable
supply actually cause wear and tear on the system. Keep in mind that the
politicians are the ones who put pressure on the utilities for what
energy mix to make. So just as misconceptions affect the outcome for
nuclear they also affect the outcome for renewables.

The economics of renewables is tied in with the load following energy
sources of power that replace wind and solar for during their downtime,
which is most of the time. They are referred to by utility people as
negative load sources. Here’s the catch 22. Add renewables to the mix
and you are automatically going to need backup. No city can survive with
intermittent power. So more than half (the inconvenient truth) of wind
and solar are not producing so the void is filled with natural gas, coal
or nuclear.

Renewables are also land-intensive. Trying to compare them to nuclear is
futile. They lose on so many levels that it’s just plain silly to
compare. Again it is like a car compared to a bicycle. Simply not a fair
comparison. But it is the farms we mostly are against because they can
have sudden spikes of power that traditional grids are not designed to
handle.

Wind has the most money spent for electrical power gained disrupting
smooth grid transmissions. The economics of renewables are such that the
consumer pays more for electricity because of the subsidies that
guarantee rates whether there is wind or sunlight available. The impact
is that the consumer is paying twice. Once for the gas and once for the
stalled wind and solar.

Solar can be less disruptive if spread out and installed & used by local
home rooftops, schools, or businesses because they have not yet reached
saturation where they can be disruptive. The personal rooftop’s output
is buffered by immediate use of the owner. One proposal to dealing with
intermittent unreliable sources is to create an  independent grid of
their own letting the cities prime functions alone.

But more importantly Wind and Solar and other intermittent energy
sources need to be rethought and the separation of baseload dependent
electrical use and less critical electrical use, so that renewable
energy sources can be applied locally and coupled with storage and not a
part of the same grid that carries baseload. One such beneficial example
is using solar power to keep batteries for low wattage voltage heat
pumps that are part of a geothermal installation.

If energy policy includes making responsible decisions about how we
spend and the environmental impact from the development to the final
installation, then a whole range of factors that go beyond merely
delegating what power sources to use but also considering what materials
from rare earths that come from China are part of the wind mill’s and
solar panel’s design. They are long term hazards. Other unfriendly
hidden factors such as desert solar farms require preparation that kills
any wildlife or vegetation near the solar farm that could possibly allow
growth or interference with the unmanned panels. How much thought has
gone into disposal of end-of-life panels and wind turbines. There is
indeed an inversely proportional amount for how much land and
construction materials are needed and how much energy is produced when
comparing small footprint nuclear energy to renewables.

Fossil Fuels - Coal

The worst offenders by far are Coal Plants! Coal generates 40% of
Earth’s electricity and about 25% of its carbon dioxide emissions. 
London’s Great Smog of ’52 is a perfect example. Read about it here:

www.metoffice.gov.uk/education/teens/case-studies/great-smog

There are states that still have over 50% of their power from coal. But
it is true that the US burns less coal than they once did but that is a
deception. The coal they mine is still being burned but just not in the
US. We need to consider creating more coal gasification plants to keep
the coal business alive which means less exporting and more developing.
But the long term goal should be to phase out coal mining for fuel.
Again energy awareness needs to take the big picture into account. We
can’t ignore that China is building a new coal plant every week to meet
their expanding economic needs. We export coal but we used to export
knowledge too. Somehow we fell behind. Catching up to our once proud
position as the most technologically advanced country will begin when we
accept nuclear science as part of our reality.

Fossil Fuel - ``Natural'' Gas

Because of what appears to be some bad apples, fracking has got a bad
name. There is satellite evidence that shows more methane escape than is
being reported from the wells. This under-regulated industry has
examples of abusing, disfigurinand despoiling the land and water tables
but there are sources that indicate it has had a positive impact on
reducing CO₂. On the one hand America is thankful for natural gas for
helping the US to become more independent of Arab countries but on the
other it is a threat to the environment in several ways. Water, wildlife
and landscape have all suffered from the invasion of once pristine and
relatively untouched countryside. The economics of natural gas is
strongly connected to big business and the deep pockets give those
companies more leverage to artificially keep prices low to make nuclear
less able to profit. The utilities are forced to buy the cheapest energy
sources.

What about labeling methane as ``natural gas''? Does calling it
``natural'' accurately describe it’s function and properties? Methane is
a much stronger greenhouse gas than CO₂. It will stay in the atmosphere
for 29 years before converting to CO₂ which still remains. In addition,
methane is explosive and has killed far more people than nuclear. So if
explosions are natural then the name works but the intent of labeling it
``natural'' implies that it is unspoiled by human intervention. We know
now that human intervention in the fracking sense is very un-natural. In
an article titled ``Hydrofracked: One man’s quest for answers about
natural gas drilling'' the author Abrahm Lustgarten states:

``…Between 200,000 and 6 million gallons of water are mixed with a
cocktail of solvents, surfactants and acids – about 1 percent by volume
– and pumped into the well under thousands of pounds of pressure per
square inch. The intense pressure cracks open the deep rocks, releasing
the gas. Sand or other particles mixed with the fluids prop open the
artificially created fractures so that gas and fluids can flow freely.
Sometimes the drilling is turned to run horizontally – deliberately
angled to reach across thin layers of gas- and oil-bearing rock. When
horizontal wells are fracked, they use vastly more fluid and
chemicals…''

``In a typical fracked gas well, vertical or horizontal, it’s unclear
exactly how far these man-made cracks extend, or whether they connect
with natural faults and fissures to create rogue pathways for gas and
chemicals. The oil and gas industry has long insisted that fracking is
harmless…''

``Politicians who supported the industry had tried for years to exempt
fracking from the Safe Drinking Water Act, the 1974 law that regulates
the injection of waste and chemicals underground. The EPA’s 2004 study
was used to justify that effort. With the help of then-Vice President
Dick Cheney — the former head of Halliburton — President George W.
Bush’s landmark energy legislation, the 2005 Energy Policy Act, included
a provision that prohibited the EPA from regulating fracking under the
Safe Drinking Water Act. Regulation would be left to the states, many of
which had underfunded agencies, looser standards and less manpower than
the federal government…''

``Fracking works like this: First, a well is drilled thousands of feet
into the earth, passing through layers of rock and water until it
reaches the place where the gas is trapped – in shale, tight sands or
some other geological formation. The well bore, which narrows as it gets
deeper, is partially encased in steel pipe, and concrete is pumped into
the space surrounding it, extending deep enough to seal off the drinking
water aquifers. The concrete and steel are supposed to separate the well
from everything except the target zone at the bottom.''

The Misinformed Green’s Are Unwitting Accomplices in Slowing Economic
Recovery and Preventing Ecological Recovery

There have been a few cases where antinuclear protests and lobbyist
efforts have forced the closing of nuclear plants such as Vermont Yankee
and San Onofre plants and successful efforts to cancel nuclear projects.
Lawyers, who belong to the profession we most love to hate, really take
advantage of the under-educated green movement by working with nuance
and counting on the fact that the judges and jury are not well informed
on nuclear energy and they help bring about the closings of perfectly
good productive nuclear power plants.

The outcome is almost always an increase in use of fossil fuel to
replace this energy. The pollution affects the air and ocean acidity and
the utility bills go sky high. We must continue to give examples of how
much carbon dioxide is being added by removing nuclear energy from the
equation. If the ``greens'' want to pretend to be concerned about the
quality of life as a so-called ``environmentalist'' it is a must to know
the facts. You can’t play it both ways. It is tantamount to
superstition. Have we really regressed that far as a civilization?
