foundation but it was quite a large hurdle conducted by other scientists
before that could be tranlated into a bomb. American Museum of Natural
History:The Manhattan Project -see source (Federation of American
Scientists: Einstein) for the following quote: >"Dear Friend,

Through the release of atomic energy, our generation has brought into
the world the most revolutionary force since prehistoric man’s discovery
of fire. This basic power of the universe cannot be fitted into the
outmoded concept of narrow nationalisms. For there is no secret and
there is no defense; there is no possibility of control except through
the aroused understanding and insistence of the peoples of the world.
____

____
We scientists recognize our inescapable responsibility to carry to our
fellow citizens an understanding of the simple facts of atomic energy
and its implications for society. In this lies our only security and our
only hope – we believe that an informed citizenry will act for life and
not death.

We need $1,000,000 for this great educational task. Sustained by faith
in man’s ability to control his destiny through the exercise of reason,
we have pledged all our strength and our knowledge to this work. I do
not hesitate to call upon you to help.

[.endnotebold]##4-4##Alvin Weinberg’s Warnings from 1977 -

Revolvy: Alvin M. Weinberg >``In June, 1977, Weinberg testified at a
congressional hearing of the House Subcommittee on the Environment and
the Atmosphere concerning the impact of increasing carbon dioxide
emissions on global average temperatures. He stated that a doubling of
global carbon dioxide emissions by 2025, which some scientists predicted
would occur, would lead to a two-degree Celsius increase in global
average temperature.''

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am to talk to you about energy in the future. I
will start by telling you why I believe that the energy resources of the
past must be supplemented. First of all, these energy resources will run
short as we use more and more of the fossil fuels. But I would […] like
to mention another reason why we probably have to look for additional
fuel supplies. And this, strangely, is the question of contaminating the
atmosphere. [….] Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon
dioxide. [….] The carbon dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you
can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry
about it?
____

____
``Carbon dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but
it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its
presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been
calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent
increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and
submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a
considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I
think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people
tend to believe.''
____

____
``At present the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per
cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per
cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s
accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of
purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious
additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet
will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees
Fahrenheit or only one or 5.''
____

____
``But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole
globe, there is a possibility that the icecaps will start melting and
the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether
they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can
calculate it by looking at the map and noting that the icecaps over
Greenland and over Antarctica are perhaps five thousand feet thick.''

[.endnotebold]#4-5# Wikipedia: Carbon Dioxide in Earth’s Atmosphere
>``Excess CO₂ emitted since the pre-industrial era is projected to
remain in the atmosphere for centuries to millennia, even after
emissions stop. Even if human carbon dioxide emissions were to
completely cease, atmospheric temperatures are not expected to decrease
significantly for thousands of years.''
