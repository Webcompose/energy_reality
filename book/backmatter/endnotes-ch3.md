> "Pollutants produced by coal combustion act on the respiratory system to cause a variety of respiratory ailments. Air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) adversely affect lung development, reducing forced expiratory volume (FEV) among children. Reduced FEV often precedes the subsequent development of other pulmonary diseases."

> "Air pollution triggers attacks of asthma, which now affects more than 9% of all U.S. children, who are particularly susceptible to the development of pollution-related asthma attacks. Asthma exacerbations have been linked specifically to exposure to ozone, a gas produced when NO<sub>x</sub> reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. The risk to children of experiencing ozone-related asthma exists even when ambient ozone levels fall within the limits set by the EPA."

> "You will not see a nuclear power plant erupting into a mushroom cloud."

> "It is physically impossible for a U.S. commercial reactor to explode like a nuclear weapon. The reactor fuel does not have enough uranium to be explosive, and all reactors are built with many layers of safety controls and self-limiting features."

> "For example, if the reactor temperature reaches a certain level during power operations, the fission process is naturally suppressed to guarantee the power level can’t spike under any conditions. It is not possible for a person to intentionally, or unintentionally, modify a commercial nuclear reactor, its controls, or its fuel to cause an explosion. "

> "Coal was responsible for a majority of electricity generation at the start of the century and was still the source for nearly half in 2008 but has fallen steadily, accounting for 30 percent last year. Natural gas powered 34 percent of the country's electricity last year, passing coal as well as nuclear."

> "<strong>Does Nuclear Medicine Save Lives?</strong> Yes. More than 20 million Americans benefit each year from nuclear medicine procedures used to diagnose and treat a wide variety of diseases. The use of radiation in these procedures—with low risks—offers a safe and cost-effective means to provide doctors with information that would otherwise require exploratory surgery, necessitate more costly and invasive procedures or simply be unavailable. The risks of not performing a needed medical exam are usually much greater than the risks of the radiation exposures associated with the exam."

> "Nuclear medicine can be used to:
<ul><li>determine whether or not organs are functioning normally,</li>
<li>show whether the blood supply to the heart is adequate,</li>
<li>detect cancers at an early stage,</li>
<li>determine the extent of cancer and assess the response of cancer to treatment,</li>
<li>discover whether the heart can pump blood adequately,</li>
<li>identify abnormal brain lesions without exploratory surgery,</li>
<li>detect whether the brain is receiving an adequate blood supply and if brain cells are functioning or not,</li>
<li>check whether or not kidneys are functioning normally and whether the stomach is emptying properly,</li>
<li>ascertain lung function and bone density and</li>
<li>locate a bone fracture before it can be seen on an X-ray."</li></ul>

Ralph Moir comments on an interview regarding nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants:
>“...In the book, the authors make strong arguments about the virtue of taking every possible measure to ban or make illegal the use of uranium enriched above 20% ²³⁵Uranium and other isotopes that are usable to make nuclear bombs."

>It is hard to argue against the virtue of trying to undo history as the book and the interview suggest: Restrict or eliminate the use of uranium enriched above 20% and other fissile isotopes that are weaponizable. The ultimate goal is the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Who could say that is not a good goal?...
