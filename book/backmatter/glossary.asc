fertile: refers to the ability of a radiactive element to produce
fissile elements by neutron bombardment ²³⁸U,232Th : Uranium-238 and
thorium-232 are known as fertile materials, and the production of
fissile materials from them after capturing a neutron is known as
breeding. When these fertile materials capture neutrons, they are
converted into fissile plutonium -239 and uranium-233, respectively."

fissile: means that an element is capable of experiencing fission

FP: fission product FUJI: Japanese MSR concept

Generation IV Reactors: : "The most developed Gen IV reactor design, the
sodium fast reactor, has received the greatest share of funding over the
years with a number of demonstration facilities operated. The principal
Gen IV aspect of the design relates to the development of a sustainable
closed fuel cycle for the reactor. The molten-salt reactor, a less
developed technology, is considered as potentially having the greatest
inherent safety of the six models.[2][3] The very-high-temperature
reactor designs operate at much higher temperatures. This allows for
high temperature electrolysis for the efficient production of hydrogen
and the synthesis of carbon-neutral fuels.[1]

The majority of the 6 designs are generally not expected to be available
for commercial construction until 2020–30.[4] Currently the majority of
reactors in operation around the world are considered second generation
reactor systems, as the vast majority of the first generation systems
were retired some time ago, and there are only few Generation III
reactors in operation as of 2014. Generation V reactors refer to
reactors that are purely theoretical and are therefore not yet
considered feasible in the short term, resulting in limited R&D
funding." Wikipedia: Generation IV Reactor

MOX: mixed oxide fuel (U + Pu oxides) – reactor fuel, developed by the
French,  is made from uranium oxide and plutonium oxide. Usually the
plutonium is sourced from reprocessed used nuclear fuel and has the
isotopic profile known as `reactor grade', indicating it is high in
plutonium-240. The exact composition in the American program, in
collaboration with AREVA ,to start in 2016 in South Carolina, is
different because the plutonium is sourced from dismantled US nuclear
warheads, meaning it is `weapons grade' and high in plutonium-239
instead and has a correspondingly different operational signature.
