Dioxide (CO₂) Capture and Storage - edited by M. Mercedes Maroto-Valer

____
``Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) represents a key component of
a larger porfolio of advanced energy technologies and climate policies
needed to mediate the rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Geologic
CCS systems are specifically designed to remove CO₂ from various point
sources and safely deposit CO₂ in secure storage sites deep
underground…''

[.endnotebold]##0-8##Book: Non-Solutions Project: Here are a few quotes
from Mathijs Beckers’ book. He does an excellent job of projecting the
amount of materials needed to run a so-called 100% renewables scenario.
Beckers does an admirable job of laying it all out using graphs,
equations, numbers and analysis:

____
``Copper has many uses: wiring; in semiconductors as circuitry; in
piping and plumbing; as a building material; in electric motors; we even
use it as a hull material for boats, but renewables have only had a
marginal share of all available copper. However, that will change if we
choose to implement the 100%WWS Roadmap. Copper use for wind and solar
is currently only 3.3%, but if we adopt the roadmap plan it could rise
to 75~80%. The limitations of copper production might just be the straw
that will break the camel’s back…''
____

____
``It is important to note that known reserves are roughly 720,000
thousand metric tons. Suppose we could reach 100,000 TWh of annual
energy production on Wind and Solar, and it would require 200,000
thousand metric tons of copper, we would have extracted more than
one-fourth of all the copper known to be available. It is not so much
the amount of copper required that makes this challenge so big, it is
about the increase in copper production growth required, that makes it
hard to achieve…''
____

____
``Even if we keep production as high as possible, we wouldn’t be able to
build all the wind turbines and solar panels required before 2050 due to
the deficit in copper. Also note that we are already behind 1500 GW of
annual required wind and solar additions (which is about 15 times more
than we currently add)…''
____

____
``Shortages of rare earths already plague the renewable industry.
Research institutes confirm that there’s a tremendous strain on
resources already and foresee a shortage of materials in the
not-so-distant future. I doubt that we can sustain the raw material
production levels that are needed to facilitate this rapid growth in
wind and solar as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap. And research and
development on raw material recovery is lagging, so we may conclude that
the 100%WWS Roadmap is already facing serious startup problems…''
____

____
``If we want to do an all-out build-off bonanza as required in the
100%WWS Roadmap, we will be faced with massive shortages so long as
mining capabilities trail behind the demand. Lake Baotou in China, which
is a dystopian place, is one of the shady sides of rare earth mining.
Once the rare earth materials have been mined, you have to separate them
from the ore, which is done by a host of different chemical processes
with hazardous tailings and other valuable elements going to waste…''
____

____
``The people who work in the mines and live near the refineries pay the
price for our technologies. So let’s go for the technologies that are
most efficient in terms of materials used. As long as we fail to clean
up our mining and purification practices, `clean energy' will be an
oxymoron…''
____

____
``However, we already have a safe, efficient, environmentally friendly
technology for generating electricity―nuclear energy, especially when
produced by modern plants that can''burn" our stored nuclear waste as
fuel…"
