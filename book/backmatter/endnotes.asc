``Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) represents a key component of
a larger porfolio of advanced energy technologies and climate policies
needed to mediate the rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Geologic
CCS systems are specifically designed to remove CO₂ from various point
sources and safely deposit CO₂ in secure storage sites deep
underground…''

[.endnotebold]##0-8##Book: Non-Solutions Project: Here are a few quotes
from Mathijs Beckers’ book. He does an excellent job of projecting the
amount of materials needed to run a so-called 100% renewables scenario.
Beckers does an admirable job of laying it all out using graphs,
equations, numbers and analysis:

____
``Copper has many uses: wiring; in semiconductors as circuitry; in
piping and plumbing; as a building material; in electric motors; we even
use it as a hull material for boats, but renewables have only had a
marginal share of all available copper. However, that will change if we
choose to implement the 100%WWS Roadmap. Copper use for wind and solar
is currently only 3.3%, but if we adopt the roadmap plan it could rise
to 75~80%. The limitations of copper production might just be the straw
that will break the camel’s back…''
____

____
``It is important to note that known reserves are roughly 720,000
thousand metric tons. Suppose we could reach 100,000 TWh of annual
energy production on Wind and Solar, and it would require 200,000
thousand metric tons of copper, we would have extracted more than
one-fourth of all the copper known to be available. It is not so much
the amount of copper required that makes this challenge so big, it is
about the increase in copper production growth required, that makes it
hard to achieve…''
____

____
``Even if we keep production as high as possible, we wouldn’t be able to
build all the wind turbines and solar panels required before 2050 due to
the deficit in copper. Also note that we are already behind 1500 GW of
annual required wind and solar additions (which is about 15 times more
than we currently add)…''
____

____
``Shortages of rare earths already plague the renewable industry.
Research institutes confirm that there’s a tremendous strain on
resources already and foresee a shortage of materials in the
not-so-distant future. I doubt that we can sustain the raw material
production levels that are needed to facilitate this rapid growth in
wind and solar as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap. And research and
development on raw material recovery is lagging, so we may conclude that
the 100%WWS Roadmap is already facing serious startup problems…''
____

____
``If we want to do an all-out build-off bonanza as required in the
100%WWS Roadmap, we will be faced with massive shortages so long as
mining capabilities trail behind the demand. Lake Baotou in China, which
is a dystopian place, is one of the shady sides of rare earth mining.
Once the rare earth materials have been mined, you have to separate them
from the ore, which is done by a host of different chemical processes
with hazardous tailings and other valuable elements going to waste…''
____

____
``The people who work in the mines and live near the refineries pay the
price for our technologies. So let’s go for the technologies that are
most efficient in terms of materials used. As long as we fail to clean
up our mining and purification practices, `clean energy' will be an
oxymoron…''
____

____
``However, we already have a safe, efficient, environmentally friendly
technology for generating electricity―nuclear energy, especially when
produced by modern plants that can''burn" our stored nuclear waste as
fuel…"

"Ladies and gentlemen, I am to talk to you about energy in the future. I
will start by telling you why I believe that the energy resources of the
past must be supplemented. First of all, these energy resources will run
short as we use more and more of the fossil fuels. But I would […] like
to mention another reason why we probably have to look for additional
fuel supplies. And this, strangely, is the question of contaminating the
atmosphere. [….] Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon
dioxide. [….] The carbon dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you
can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry
about it?
____

____
``Carbon dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but
it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its
presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [….] It has been
calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent
increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and
submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a
considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I
think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people
tend to believe.''
____

____
``At present the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per
cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per
cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s
accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of
purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious
additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet
will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees
Fahrenheit or only one or 5.''
____

____
``But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole
globe, there is a possibility that the icecaps will start melting and
the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether
they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can
calculate it by looking at the map and noting that the icecaps over
Greenland and over Antarctica are perhaps five thousand feet thick.''

World Ocean Review: Ocean Chemistry - CO₂

Fertilizing the ocean with iron The ocean as a sink for anthropogenic
CO₂

____
``As soon as CO₂ migrates from the atmosphere into the water, it can
react chemically with water molecules to form carbonic acid, which
causes a shift in the concentrations of the hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-)
and carbo­nate (CO32-) ions, which are derived from the carbonic acid.
Because carbon dioxide is thus immediately processed in the sea, the CO₂
capacity of the oceans is ten times higher than that of freshwater, and
they therefore can absorb large quantities of it. Scientists refer to
this kind of assimilation of CO₂ as a sink. The ocean absorbs human-made
atmospheric CO₂, and this special property of seawater is primarily
attributable to carbonation, which, at 10 per cent, represents a
significant proportion of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean.
In the ocean, the carbon dissolved in the form of CO₂, bicarbonate and
carbonate is referred to as inorganic carbon. When a new carbon
equilibrium between the atmosphere and the world ocean is re-established
in the future, then the oceanic reservoir will have assimilated around
80 per cent of the anthropogenic CO₂ from the atmosphere, primarily due
to the reaction with carbonate. The buffering effect of deep-sea calcium
carbonate sediments is also important. These ancient carbonates
neutralize large amounts of CO₂ by reacting with it, and dissolving to
some extent. Thanks to these processes, the oceans could ultimately
absorb around 95 per cent of the anthropogenic emissions. Because of the
slow mixing of the ocean, however, it would take centuries before
equilib­rium is established. The very gradual buffering of CO₂ by the
reaction with carbonate sediments might even take millennia. For today’s
situation this means that a marked carbon disequilibrium between the
ocean and atmosphere will continue to exist for the decades and
centuries to come. The world ocean cannot absorb the greenhouse gas as
rapidly as it is emitted into the atmosphere by humans. The absorptive
capacity of the oceans through chemical processes in the water is
directly dependent on the rate of mixing in the world ocean. The current
oceanic uptake of CO₂ thus lags significantly behind its chemical
capacity as the present-day CO₂ emissions occur much faster than they
can be processed by the ocean.''

some way and hopefully to be a bit poetic. Given the subject matter, I
wanted the title to acknowledge the fact that the splitting of the atom

weapons. That aspect has been widely associated with the Greek myth of
Pandora’s Box. Since my film was both acknowledging the evil that sprang
from the discovery of this technology, as well as its promise, Pandora’s
Promise seemed like an apt and somewhat poetic title. It also didn’t
telegraph the meaning of the film too directly, as would have happened
if I had used the word `nuclear' in the title. So I’m happy with it.''

[.endnotebold]##6-28##https://www.world-nuclear.orgUranium found in
nature consists largely of two isotopes, ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U. The production
of energy in nuclear reactors is from the `fission' or splitting of the
²³⁵U atoms, a process which releases energy in the form of heat. ²³⁵U is
the main fissile isotope of uranium.

Most reactors are light water reactors (of two types – PWR and BWR) and
require uranium to be enriched from 0.7% to 3-5% ²³⁵U in their fuel.
This is normal low-enriched uranium (LEU). There is some interest in
taking enrichment levels to about 7%, and even close to 20% for certain
special power reactor fuels, as high-assay LEU (HALEU).

²³⁵Uranium and ²³⁸U are chemically identical, but differ in their
physical properties, notably their mass. The nucleus of the ²³⁵U atom
contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons, giving an atomic mass of 235
units. The ²³⁸U nucleus also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons – three
more than ²³⁵U – and therefore has a mass of 238 units.

The difference in mass between ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U allows the isotopes to be
separated and makes it possible to increase or ``enrich'' the percentage
of ²³⁵U. All present and historic enrichment processes, directly or
indirectly, make use of this small mass difference.

[.endnotebold]##6-29##https://www.world-nuclear.org``Natural uranium
contains 0.7% of the ²³⁵U isotope. The remaining 99.3% is mostly the
²³⁸U isotope which does not contribute directly to the fission process
(though it does so indirectly by the formation of fissile isotopes of
plutonium). Isotope separation is a physical process to concentrate
(`enrich') one isotope relative to others. Some reactors, for example
the Canadian-designed Candu and the British MagNOx reactors, use natural
uranium as their fuel.'' [.endnotebold]##6-30##(For comparison, uranium
used for nuclear weapons would have to be enriched in plants specially
designed to produce at least 90% ²³⁵U.)

Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence, Sagan wrote a
timeline for the Universe, starting with the Big Bang about 15 billion
years ago. Today, we think that it all started about 13.7 Billion years
back.'' Sagan used the twelve months of the year to span all of time
since the Big Bang. Using this scale life did not emerge until the last
month.
