[.endnotebold]##6-2##Nuclear For Climate: No other choice than nuclear
Robert Stone explains the title >``The title for a film is always a
complex thing. You want the title to capture people’s imagination in
some way and hopefully to be a bit poetic. Given the subject matter, I
wanted the title to acknowledge the fact that the splitting of the atom
has had negative effects, specifically in the development of nuclear
weapons. That aspect has been widely associated with the Greek myth of
Pandora’s Box. Since my film was both acknowledging the evil that sprang
from the discovery of this technology, as well as its promise, Pandora’s
Promise seemed like an apt and somewhat poetic title. It also didn’t
telegraph the meaning of the film too directly, as would have happened
if I had used the word `nuclear' in the title. So I’m happy with it.''

[.endnotebold]##6-28##https://www.world-nuclear.orgUranium found in
nature consists largely of two isotopes, ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U. The production
of energy in nuclear reactors is from the `fission' or splitting of the
²³⁵U atoms, a process which releases energy in the form of heat. ²³⁵U is
the main fissile isotope of uranium.

Most reactors are light water reactors (of two types – PWR and BWR) and
require uranium to be enriched from 0.7% to 3-5% ²³⁵U in their fuel.
This is normal low-enriched uranium (LEU). There is some interest in
taking enrichment levels to about 7%, and even close to 20% for certain
special power reactor fuels, as high-assay LEU (HALEU).

²³⁵Uranium and ²³⁸U are chemically identical, but differ in their
physical properties, notably their mass. The nucleus of the ²³⁵U atom
contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons, giving an atomic mass of 235
units. The ²³⁸U nucleus also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons – three
more than ²³⁵U – and therefore has a mass of 238 units.

The difference in mass between ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U allows the isotopes to be
separated and makes it possible to increase or ``enrich'' the percentage
of ²³⁵U. All present and historic enrichment processes, directly or
indirectly, make use of this small mass difference.

[.endnotebold]##6-29##https://www.world-nuclear.org``Natural uranium
contains 0.7% of the ²³⁵U isotope. The remaining 99.3% is mostly the
²³⁸U isotope which does not contribute directly to the fission process
(though it does so indirectly by the formation of fissile isotopes of
plutonium). Isotope separation is a physical process to concentrate
(`enrich') one isotope relative to others. Some reactors, for example
the Canadian-designed Candu and the British MagNOx reactors, use natural
uranium as their fuel.'' [.endnotebold]##6-30##(For comparison, uranium
used for nuclear weapons would have to be enriched in plants specially
designed to produce at least 90% ²³⁵U.)

[.endnotebold]##6-40##``²³⁵U is naturally occurring. It is possible to
breed 233U and ²³⁹Pu from more common naturally occurring isotopes
(Th-232 and ²³⁸U respectively) by single neutron capture. The others are
typically produced in smaller quantities through further neutron
absorption.'' [.endnotebold]##6-41##Cameco Mines - Wikipedia

Google Books [.endnotebold]##6-49##``The famous astronomer and
astrobiologist Carl Sagan popularized the concept of a cosmic calendar
about three decades ago. In his 1977 book The Dragons of Eden:
Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence, Sagan wrote a
timeline for the Universe, starting with the Big Bang about 15 billion
years ago. Today, we think that it all started about 13.7 Billion years
back.'' Sagan used the twelve months of the year to span all of time
since the Big Bang. Using this scale life did not emerge until the last
month.
