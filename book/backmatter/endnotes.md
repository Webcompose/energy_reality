</a> - edited by M. Mercedes Maroto-Valer

> "Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) represents a key component of a larger porfolio of advanced energy technologies and climate policies needed to mediate the rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration. Geologic CCS systems are specifically designed to remove CO₂ from various point sources and safely deposit CO₂ in secure storage sites deep underground..."

The experiments for ocean CCS still needs greater investigation.

He does an excellent job of projecting the amount of materials needed to run a so-called 100% renewables scenario. Beckers does an admirable job of laying it all out using graphs, equations, numbers and analysis:

> "Copper has many uses: wiring; in semiconductors as circuitry; in piping and plumbing; as a building material; in electric motors; we even use it as a hull material for boats, but renewables have only had a marginal share of all available copper. However, that will change if we choose to implement the 100%WWS Roadmap. Copper use for wind and solar is currently only 3.3%, but if we adopt the roadmap plan it could rise to 75~80%. The limitations of copper production might just be the straw that will break the camel's back..."

> "It is important to note that known reserves are roughly 720,000 thousand metric tons. Suppose we could reach 100,000 TWh of annual energy production on Wind and Solar, and it would require 200,000 thousand metric tons of copper, we would have extracted more than one-fourth of all the copper known to be available. It is not so much the amount of copper required that makes this challenge so big, it is about the increase in copper production growth required, that makes it hard to achieve..."

> "Even if we keep production as high as possible, we wouldn't be able to build all the wind turbines and solar panels required before 2050 due to the deficit in copper. Also note that we are already behind 1500 GW of annual required wind and solar additions (which is about 15 times more than we currently add)..."

> "Shortages of rare earths already plague the renewable industry. Research institutes confirm that there's a tremendous strain on resources already and foresee a shortage of materials in the not-so-distant future. I doubt that we can sustain the raw material production levels that are needed to facilitate this rapid growth in wind and solar as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap. And research and development on raw material recovery is lagging, so we may conclude that the 100%WWS Roadmap is already facing serious startup problems..."

> "If we want to do an all-out build-off bonanza as required in the 100%WWS Roadmap, we will be faced with massive shortages so long as mining capabilities trail behind the demand. Lake Baotou in China, which is a dystopian place, is one of the shady sides of rare earth mining. Once the rare earth materials have been mined, you have to separate them from the ore, which is done by a host of different chemical processes with hazardous tailings and other valuable elements going to waste..."

> "The people who work in the mines and live near the refineries pay the price for our technologies. So let's go for the technologies that are most efficient in terms of materials used. As long as we fail to clean up our mining and purification practices, 'clean energy' will be an oxymoron..."

> "However, we already have a safe, efficient, environmentally friendly technology for generating electricity―nuclear energy, especially when produced by modern plants that can "burn" our stored nuclear waste as fuel..."

> "Pollutants produced by coal combustion act on the respiratory system to cause a variety of respiratory ailments. Air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>) and fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) adversely affect lung development, reducing forced expiratory volume (FEV) among children. Reduced FEV often precedes the subsequent development of other pulmonary diseases."

> "Air pollution triggers attacks of asthma, which now affects more than 9% of all U.S. children, who are particularly susceptible to the development of pollution-related asthma attacks. Asthma exacerbations have been linked specifically to exposure to ozone, a gas produced when NO<sub>x</sub> reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. The risk to children of experiencing ozone-related asthma exists even when ambient ozone levels fall within the limits set by the EPA."

> "You will not see a nuclear power plant erupting into a mushroom cloud."

> "It is physically impossible for a U.S. commercial reactor to explode like a nuclear weapon. The reactor fuel does not have enough uranium to be explosive, and all reactors are built with many layers of safety controls and self-limiting features."

> "For example, if the reactor temperature reaches a certain level during power operations, the fission process is naturally suppressed to guarantee the power level can’t spike under any conditions. It is not possible for a person to intentionally, or unintentionally, modify a commercial nuclear reactor, its controls, or its fuel to cause an explosion. "

> "<strong>Does Nuclear Medicine Save Lives?</strong> Yes. More than 20 million Americans benefit each year from nuclear medicine procedures used to diagnose and treat a wide variety of diseases. The use of radiation in these procedures—with low risks—offers a safe and cost-effective means to provide doctors with information that would otherwise require exploratory surgery, necessitate more costly and invasive procedures or simply be unavailable. The risks of not performing a needed medical exam are usually much greater than the risks of the radiation exposures associated with the exam."

Ralph Moir comments on an interview regarding nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants:
>“...In the book, the authors make strong arguments about the virtue of taking every possible measure to ban or make illegal the use of uranium enriched above 20% ²³⁵Uranium and other isotopes that are usable to make nuclear bombs."

>It is hard to argue against the virtue of trying to undo history as the book and the interview suggest: Restrict or eliminate the use of uranium enriched above 20% and other fissile isotopes that are weaponizable. The ultimate goal is the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Who could say that is not a good goal?...

>"Dear Friend,

>I write to you for help at the suggestion of a friend.

>Through the release of atomic energy, our generation has brought into the world the most revolutionary force since prehistoric man's discovery of fire. This basic power of the universe cannot be fitted into the outmoded concept of narrow nationalisms. For there is no secret and there is no defense; there is no possibility of control except through the aroused understanding and insistence of the peoples of the world.

>We scientists recognize our inescapable responsibility to carry to our fellow citizens an understanding of the simple facts of atomic energy and its implications for society. In this lies our only security and our only hope -- we believe that an informed citizenry will act for life and not death.

>We need $1,000,000 for this great educational task. Sustained by faith in man's ability to control his destiny through the exercise of reason, we have pledged all our strength and our knowledge to this work. I do not hesitate to call upon you to help.

>"Ladies and gentlemen, I am to talk to you about energy in the future. I will start by telling you why I believe that the energy resources of the past must be supplemented. First of all, these energy resources will run short as we use more and more of the fossil fuels. But I would [...] like to mention another reason why we probably have to look for additional fuel supplies. And this, strangely, is the question of contaminating the atmosphere. [....] Whenever you burn conventional fuel, you create carbon dioxide. [....] The carbon dioxide is invisible, it is transparent, you can’t smell it, it is not dangerous to health, so why should one worry about it?

>"Carbon dioxide has a strange property. It transmits visible light but it absorbs the infrared radiation which is emitted from the earth. Its presence in the atmosphere causes a greenhouse effect [....] It has been calculated that a temperature rise corresponding to a 10 per cent increase in carbon dioxide will be sufficient to melt the icecap and submerge New York. All the coastal cities would be covered, and since a considerable percentage of the human race lives in coastal regions, I think that this chemical contamination is more serious than most people tend to believe."

>"At present the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen by 2 per cent over normal. By 1970, it will be perhaps 4 per cent, by 1980, 8 per cent, by 1990, 16 per cent [about 360 parts per million, by Teller’s accounting], if we keep on with our exponential rise in the use of purely conventional fuels. By that time, there will be a serious additional impediment for the radiation leaving the earth. Our planet will get a little warmer. It is hard to say whether it will be 2 degrees Fahrenheit or only one or 5."

>"But when the temperature does rise by a few degrees over the whole globe, there is a possibility that the icecaps will start melting and the level of the oceans will begin to rise. Well, I don’t know whether they will cover the Empire State Building or not, but anyone can calculate it by looking at the map and noting that the icecaps over Greenland and over Antarctica are perhaps five thousand feet thick."

<a href="https://worldoceanreview.com/en/wor-1/ocean-chemistry/co2-reservoir/">World Ocean Review: Ocean Chemistry - CO₂</a>

Fertilizing the ocean with iron The ocean as a sink for anthropogenic CO₂

>"As soon as CO₂ migrates from the atmosphere into the water, it can react chemically with water molecules to form carbonic acid, which causes a shift in the concentrations of the hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-) and carbo­nate (CO32-) ions, which are derived from the carbonic acid. Because carbon dioxide is thus immediately processed in the sea, the CO₂ capacity of the oceans is ten times higher than that of freshwater, and they therefore can absorb large quantities of it. Scientists refer to this kind of assimilation of CO₂ as a sink. The ocean absorbs human-made atmospheric CO₂, and this special property of seawater is primarily attributable to carbonation, which, at 10 per cent, represents a significant proportion of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean. In the ocean, the carbon dissolved in the form of CO₂, bicarbonate and carbonate is referred to as inorganic carbon. When a new carbon equilibrium between the atmosphere and the world ocean is re-established in the future, then the oceanic reservoir will have assimilated around 80 per cent of the anthropogenic CO₂ from the atmosphere, primarily due to the reaction with carbonate. The buffering effect of deep-sea calcium carbonate sediments is also important. These ancient carbonates neutralize large amounts of CO₂ by reacting with it, and dissolving to some extent. Thanks to these processes, the oceans could ultimately absorb around 95 per cent of the anthropogenic emissions. Because of the slow mixing of the ocean, however, it would take centuries before equilib­rium is established. The very gradual buffering of CO₂ by the reaction with carbonate sediments might even take millennia. For today’s situation this means that a marked carbon disequilibrium between the ocean and atmosphere will continue to exist for the decades and centuries to come. The world ocean cannot absorb the greenhouse gas as rapidly as it is emitted into the atmosphere by humans. The absorptive capacity of the oceans through chemical processes in the water is directly dependent on the rate of mixing in the world ocean. The current oceanic uptake of CO₂ thus lags significantly behind its chemical capacity as the present-day CO₂ emissions occur much faster than they can be processed by the ocean."

>"The title for a film is always a complex thing. You want the title to capture people’s imagination in some way and hopefully to be a bit poetic. Given the subject matter, I wanted the title to acknowledge the fact that the splitting of the atom has had negative effects, specifically in the development of nuclear weapons. That aspect has been widely associated with the Greek myth of Pandora’s Box. Since my film was both acknowledging the evil that sprang from the discovery of this technology, as well as its promise, Pandora’s Promise seemed like an apt and somewhat poetic title. It also didn’t telegraph the meaning of the film too directly, as would have happened if I had used the word 'nuclear' in the title. So I’m happy with it."

<span class="endnotebold">6-28</span><a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/conversion-enrichment-and-fabrication/uranium-enrichment.aspx" target="_blank">https://www.world-nuclear.org</a><br />Uranium found in nature consists largely of two isotopes, ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U. The production of energy in nuclear reactors is from the 'fission' or splitting of the ²³⁵U atoms, a process which releases energy in the form of heat. ²³⁵U is the main fissile isotope of uranium.

Most reactors are light water reactors (of two types – PWR and BWR) and require uranium to be enriched from 0.7% to 3-5% ²³⁵U in their fuel. This is normal low-enriched uranium (LEU). There is some interest in taking enrichment levels to about 7%, and even close to 20% for certain special power reactor fuels, as high-assay LEU (HALEU).

²³⁵Uranium and ²³⁸U are chemically identical, but differ in their physical properties, notably their mass. The nucleus of the ²³⁵U atom contains 92 protons and 143 neutrons, giving an atomic mass of 235 units. The ²³⁸U nucleus also has 92 protons but has 146 neutrons – three more than ²³⁵U – and therefore has a mass of 238 units.

The difference in mass between ²³⁵U and ²³⁸U allows the isotopes to be separated and makes it possible to increase or "enrich" the percentage of ²³⁵U. All present and historic enrichment processes, directly or indirectly, make use of this small mass difference.

The remaining 99.3% is mostly the ²³⁸U isotope which does not contribute directly to the fission process (though it does so indirectly by the formation of fissile isotopes of plutonium). Isotope separation is a physical process to concentrate (‘enrich’) one isotope relative to others. Some reactors, for example the Canadian-designed Candu and the British MagNO<sub>x</sub> reactors, use natural uranium as their fuel."

In his 1977 book <i>The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the evolution of human intelligence,</i> Sagan wrote a timeline for the Universe, starting with the Big Bang about 15 billion years ago. Today, we think that it all started about 13.7 Billion years back."</a>
<br />Sagan used the twelve months of the year to span all of time since the Big Bang. Using this scale life did not emerge until the last month.
