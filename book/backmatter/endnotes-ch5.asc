World Ocean Review: Ocean Chemistry - CO₂

Fertilizing the ocean with iron The ocean as a sink for anthropogenic
CO₂

____
``As soon as CO₂ migrates from the atmosphere into the water, it can
react chemically with water molecules to form carbonic acid, which
causes a shift in the concentrations of the hydrogen carbonate (HCO3-)
and carbo­nate (CO32-) ions, which are derived from the carbonic acid.
Because carbon dioxide is thus immediately processed in the sea, the CO₂
capacity of the oceans is ten times higher than that of freshwater, and
they therefore can absorb large quantities of it. Scientists refer to
this kind of assimilation of CO₂ as a sink. The ocean absorbs human-made
atmospheric CO₂, and this special property of seawater is primarily
attributable to carbonation, which, at 10 per cent, represents a
significant proportion of the dissolved inorganic carbon in the ocean.
In the ocean, the carbon dissolved in the form of CO₂, bicarbonate and
carbonate is referred to as inorganic carbon. When a new carbon
equilibrium between the atmosphere and the world ocean is re-established
in the future, then the oceanic reservoir will have assimilated around
80 per cent of the anthropogenic CO₂ from the atmosphere, primarily due
to the reaction with carbonate. The buffering effect of deep-sea calcium
carbonate sediments is also important. These ancient carbonates
neutralize large amounts of CO₂ by reacting with it, and dissolving to
some extent. Thanks to these processes, the oceans could ultimately
absorb around 95 per cent of the anthropogenic emissions. Because of the
slow mixing of the ocean, however, it would take centuries before
equilib­rium is established. The very gradual buffering of CO₂ by the
reaction with carbonate sediments might even take millennia. For today’s
situation this means that a marked carbon disequilibrium between the
ocean and atmosphere will continue to exist for the decades and
centuries to come. The world ocean cannot absorb the greenhouse gas as
rapidly as it is emitted into the atmosphere by humans. The absorptive
capacity of the oceans through chemical processes in the water is
directly dependent on the rate of mixing in the world ocean. The current
oceanic uptake of CO₂ thus lags significantly behind its chemical
capacity as the present-day CO₂ emissions occur much faster than they
can be processed by the ocean.''
