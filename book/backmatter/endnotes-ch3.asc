[.endnotebold]##3-12##Excerpt: (from same article above) > ``Pollutants
produced by coal combustion act on the respiratory system to cause a
variety of respiratory ailments. Air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides
(NOx) and fine particulate matter (i.e. PM2.5) adversely affect lung
development, reducing forced expiratory volume (FEV) among children.
Reduced FEV often precedes the subsequent development of other pulmonary
diseases.''

____
``Air pollution triggers attacks of asthma, which now affects more than
9% of all U.S. children, who are particularly susceptible to the
development of pollution-related asthma attacks. Asthma exacerbations
have been linked specifically to exposure to ozone, a gas produced when
NOx reacts with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight
and heat. The risk to children of experiencing ozone-related asthma
exists even when ambient ozone levels fall within the limits set by the
EPA.''

[.endnotebold]##3-27##Duke Energy: Common Myths About Nuclear Energy
Jun. 12, 2013

____
``You will not see a nuclear power plant erupting into a mushroom
cloud.''
____

____
``It is physically impossible for a U.S. commercial reactor to explode
like a nuclear weapon. The reactor fuel does not have enough uranium to
be explosive, and all reactors are built with many layers of safety
controls and self-limiting features.''
____

____
``For example, if the reactor temperature reaches a certain level during
power operations, the fission process is naturally suppressed to
guarantee the power level can’t spike under any conditions. It is not
possible for a person to intentionally, or unintentionally, modify a
commercial nuclear reactor, its controls, or its fuel to cause an
explosion.''

by John Muyskens, Dan Keating and Samuel Granados - Updated Mar. 28,
2017

____
``Coal was responsible for a majority of electricity generation at the
start of the century and was still the source for nearly half in 2008
but has fallen steadily, accounting for 30 percent last year. Natural
gas powered 34 percent of the country’s electricity last year, passing
coal as well as nuclear.''

SNMMI and Safe/Beneficial Medical Uses of Radiation

____
``Does Nuclear Medicine Save Lives? Yes. More than 20 million Americans
benefit each year from nuclear medicine procedures used to diagnose and
treat a wide variety of diseases. The use of radiation in these
procedures—with low risks—offers a safe and cost-effective means to
provide doctors with information that would otherwise require
exploratory surgery, necessitate more costly and invasive procedures or
simply be unavailable. The risks of not performing a needed medical exam
are usually much greater than the risks of the radiation exposures
associated with the exam.''
____

____
"Nuclear medicine can be used to:

determine whether or not organs are functioning normally,

show whether the blood supply to the heart is adequate,

detect cancers at an early stage,

determine the extent of cancer and assess the response of cancer to
treatment,

discover whether the heart can pump blood adequately,

identify abnormal brain lesions without exploratory surgery,

detect whether the brain is receiving an adequate blood supply and if
brain cells are functioning or not,

check whether or not kidneys are functioning normally and whether the
stomach is emptying properly,

ascertain lung function and bone density and

locate a bone fracture before it can be seen on an X-ray."

Physics Today: Nuclear weapons vs. nuclear energy by Ralph Moir -
Nov. 1, 2015

Ralph Moir comments on an interview regarding nuclear weapons and
nuclear power plants: >``…In the book, the authors make strong arguments
about the virtue of taking every possible measure to ban or make illegal
the use of uranium enriched above 20% ²³⁵Uranium and other isotopes that
are usable to make nuclear bombs.''

____
It is hard to argue against the virtue of trying to undo history as the
book and the interview suggest: Restrict or eliminate the use of uranium
enriched above 20% and other fissile isotopes that are weaponizable. The
ultimate goal is the elimination of all nuclear weapons. Who could say
that is not a good goal?…
