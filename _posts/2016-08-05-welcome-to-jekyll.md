# The Stewards Who We Need to Support

Many thanks to the following people (listed alphabetically) who directly or indirectly provided me with assistance in putting this book together.

**Meredith Angwin** has been a mentor and colleague who has written Campaigning for Clean Air. It is full of good advice on advocacy for Nuclear Energy.

**Wade Allison** is a retired professor from Oxford University who has authored several books about radiation. You can get an education just by visiting his website named after his recent book <a href="http://www.radiationandreason.com/" target="_blank">Radiation and Reason</a>.

**Rod Adams** has an excellent blog called <a href="http://atomicinsights.com" target="_blank">Atomic Insights</a> with a wealth of nuclear energy related posts and podcasts going back to the last century. Seriously.

**Steve Aplin** has been an energy consultant in Canada for a number of years and creates some excellent posts. Some that shed light on the power and energy density of various energy sources and others that help present a good picture of the energy scene. He also has up to date data statistics at <a href="canadianenergyissues.com" target="_blank">Canadian Energy Issues</a>.

**Mathijs 'Thies' Beckers** is a prolific author, whom I happen to quote, that has a knack with numbers and statistics and has written three books in the last four years.

**Christopher Bergan** is a friend and moderator of Energy Reality Project Facebook group and provides a great service voluntarily like myself. He has also contributed many excellent posts as well as a few educational website posts.

**Tom Blees** wrote an important book called <a href="https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781419655821">Prescription for the Planet</a>

**Barry Brook** is an environmental scientist 
from Australia and is the founder of <a href="http://bravenewclimate.com" target="_blank">Brave New Climate</a> which no longer makes posts but remains a good source of discussion from other scholars, scientists, engineers and advocates.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand" target="_blank">Stewart Brand</a> has been a reminder that green environmentalists can change their mind about nuclear energy. He was the editor of the Whole Earth Catalog. More recently Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto 2009. Runs a series of lectures/interviews with the Long Now Foundation.

**Alex Cannara** has provided an unofficial forum for his members of Thorium Energy Silicon Valley, more recently called TESV Xero-Carbon, and has provided a regular newsletter Climate/Food/Energy that summarizes recent or topical references to current activity. It is an email based group relying on a committed bunch of advocates who write to members of congress, media outlets and NGOs who do not yet see the full picture, raising awareness and educating the decision-makers. I quote Alex in the "Energy Does It All" chapter and the background on Ocean Acidification. He also provided the analogy of the "pinky" sized pellet of uranium providing so much power.

**James Conca** is a devoted journalist and educator. Many of his articles cover the topics that interest followers of Energy Reality.

**Mike Conley** and **Timothy Maloney** are a good writing team who's biggest contribution so far is the  Roadmap to Nowhere http://RoadmapToNowhere.com.

**Leslie Corrice** is a former nuclear power plant operator, a member of Scientists for Accurate Radiation Information and keeps updates about the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant at his excellent http://hiroshimasyndrome.com

**Gwyneth Cravens** is an author of an excellent educational resource from her book called Power to Save the World: The Truth About Nuclear Energy where she engages on a journey of discovery with the help of an expert guide **Rip Anderson.**

**Jerry Cuttler** is a tireless advocate for fighting the misconceptions about radiation. He has worn many hats over his long career in various roles supporting nuclear energy including his own research and analysis on low dose radiation.

**James Hansen** is admired and respected for his advocacy for protecting the environment and as the leading Climate Scientist. His leadership in raising awareness has been unparalleled. From his first reports about climate change and global warming, he has delivered numerous testimonials and brought attention to human caused global warming. His numerous protest and arrests were widely publicized in all news outlets. He has no reservations about nuclear power as a necessary clean energy source that must replace coal and other fossil fuels. It was a big moment during the Paris Climate Summit when he was joined by leading climate scientists **Dr. Ken Caldeira**, **Dr. Tom Wigely** and **Dr. Kerry Emmanuel** to endorse nuclear energy.

**Robert Hargraves** is an author, professor and board member for Thorcon. His book Thorium: Energy Cheaper Than Coal has been an important contribution to the discussions concerning the future of energy world wide. His lecture and Ted Talk have been an important influence to myself and most other modern reactor enthusiasts. His concepts have been shared widely among nuclear energy advocates.

**John Haugeland** is the layout advisor and architect of the books components. John humbly calls himself an "average" citizen who does his best to advocate for an engineering-driven practical focus on nuclear energy, with a special emphasis on deploying things which already have factories and good safety records.  John's primary interests are in dispelling safety myths, and helping clarify the need for short-term action on building what he believes are the world's safest, cheapest forms of power.
John's sole actual interest is the prevention of climate change; his nuclear activism is a result of his belief that nuclear is the only non-future technology ready to meet this planet's near term needs. I happen to agree.

**Lars Jorgenson** is a lead architect of the Thorcon reactor. He is generous with his comments in the various energy forums.

**John Kutsch** is Exectutive Director of Thorium Energy Alliance which has provided a forum for entrepreneurs, engineers and scientists to present, collaborate and educate each other. He is also a board member of Terrestrial Energy. Some of my videos have been taken at his events. I gave a presentation at TEAC8 about his book. https://youtu.be/tNjZZzf5mFg

**Jim Kennedy** has a mining background and has partnered with John Kutsch to lobby for allowing rare earth mining and processing in the United States. The two of them have attended numerous meetings with congress. They hold key roles in the book Sellout by Victoria Bruce which highlights Jim Kennedy's efforts to revive the rare earths industry.

**David LeBlanc** is the engineer scientist behind Terrestrial Energy. I was lucky to have David as a conference colleague on several occasions. He taught me a lot about nuclear technology and has done an amazing job of assembling a team to get his vision of the **IMSR** off the ground in Canada and the USA.

**Gordon McDowell** is a documentary film maker who deserves a lot of credit documenting the talks from the various conferences by Thorium Energy Alliance and others. He is best known for his extensive coverage of Kirk Sorenson and created the Thorium Remix. Whenever you see a video from TEAC you can assume Gordon did the editing plus mic and camera setups. My associates Eric Meyer, Scott Medwid have also contributed as camera people when more than just a tripod was needed.

**Scott Medwid** is a strong voice promoting nuclear energy and he runs a weekly radio broadcast at Oberlin College WOBC 91.5 FM.

**Eric Meyers** started up Generation Atomic. The team he created has generated a lot of positive public relations about nuclear plants and keeping them alive. Eric is known as the operatic advocate often singing at the various rallys for the environment. I have a lot of respect for his work. They are iconic in their efforts to educate and advocate for the future of nuclear energy.

**Ed Pheil** is the Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Elysium Industries. Elysium is an advanced reactor design company seeking to develop and commercialize the Elysium Molten Chloride Salt Fast Reactor (MCSFR), representing the cross-section of nuclear energy and high-level waste management.  Ed was born and raised near Three Mile Island, which inspired him to dedicate his life to nuclear reactors because he saw that no one was harmed after the casualty. In his thirty years at the NNL,he was involved in the design and construction of the US Navy’s reactors for submarine aircraft carriers, and Jupiter spacecraft for propulsion and power. Ed devoted the majority of his career to reactor design. To this day, he has been involved in design and support for nine different reactors, including new reactors (Virginia & Columbia Class Subs, and Ford Carriers, new core startup testing for 15 reactors, as well as design studies for many types of Advanced Reactors technologies.)

**Kirk Sorensen** has become the most watched speaker on the topic of new nuclear research in the area of molten salt reactors.&nbsp; The tireless documenting skills of Gordon McDowell proved to be fruitful work making Molten Salt Reactors (MSR) the reactor of choice in Internet chats in social media worldwide. Gordon began his efforts at the Thorium Energy Alliance. The use of Thorium in an MSR attracted all kinds of engineers, scientists with rare specialties, students and nerdy environmentalists. Gordon’s videos were posted to Thorium Remix on Youtube.

**Robert Steinhaus** is a retired worker from Lawrence Livermore National Labratory and Sandia National Laboratory.

**Robert Stone** put out the film Pandora's Promise which educates the viewer by explaining how his guests had a reversal of their positions on nuclear energy. They included **Stewart Brand**, **Gwyneth Cravens**, **Mark Lynas**, **Richard Rhodes** and **Michael Shellenberger.**

**Mare Tiido-Britton** is a writer who I had many chats about the world's problems. I thank her for introducing me to Buckminster Fuller who I quote more than once and see him as the "luminary" (her word choice) he truly was. He lives on.

**Alan Waltar** is the author of <a href="#chapter-twelve">Chapter Twelve.</a> Dr. Alan Waltar was the Director of Nuclear Energy at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and is a past President and Fellow of the American Nuclear Society. He participated in the development of the report Nuclear Energy: Power for the 21st Century, which was put together by seven national laboratories.

Others I must mention as helpers either directly and indirectly: **Asha Anand**, **James Conca**,**Leslie Dewan**, **George Erickson**, **Jaro Franta**, **Bill Gates**, **Kirsty Gogan** and her group Energy For Humanity, **Ben Hammet**, **Ben Heard**, **Jim Hopf**, **Gabriel Ignetti**, **David LeBlanc**, **James Lovelock**, **Mark Lynas**, **Mothers For Nuclear**, **Ripudaman Mahotra**, **Nnadir**, **Leigh Philips**, **Richard Rhodes**, **David Schumacher**, **Jeremy Whitlock** and **Dan Yurman.**
